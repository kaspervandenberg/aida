    >First approximation: Qualities or features of things - height, weight, etc.

Qualities define a "Quality space" that inheres in other things. 

Slogan: Entities have qualities that have values. 

Questions: Can it exist on its own? (If not, may be a quality)
                  Can it have a 'value" (If so, may be a quality)
                  Does everything of a given type have it, even if you don't know
                  its value (Then probably a quality)

Distinctions: values or quale - the actual position in value space.

Pattern: Self_standing_entity has_quality Quality has_value Value

Qualities are Self_standing rather than Refining because there is an open disjoint list.  The total number of qualities for an enttiy cannot be exhaustively enumerated.

Qualities are Complexes because they do not exist on their own.

Qualities are not refining because</rdfs:comment>

    >Collectives are things like the grains of sand on the beach or the cells in a tissue.  Collectives of discrete things form amounts of mass things.

Slogans: Discrete things at one level form mass collectives at the next.
            Collectives of molecules form substances.
            Collectives of cells form (portions of) tissues.

Distinction: Group

Questions:  Can I measure it? Does it behave like a mass entity?  (then collective)

Examples: Water is (in part) a collective of molecules; Tissue is (in part) a collection of cells, etc. 

Anti examples: Flock of geese. (I can count the flocks)

NB Whether the distinction between Group and Collective is useful remains controversial.</rdfs:comment>

    >Groups, collectives, etc. and 'sets' in the sense of the Foundational Model of Anatomy.  Not mathematical sets. 

Questions: Can I say an Aggregation of one particular kind of thing?
                  Do all members perform the same function?
                  Does it retain its identity if it loses or gains a member?
                  If yes, probably an aggregation.
                  Am I interested in the behaviour of the individual members or
                  only of the whole?
