The classification of biological objects is follows the FMA "Anatomical structure" wherever possible.  However, there are biological objects which don't fit the definition of Anatomical structure and vice versa.  

In particular sets etc. are aggregations in this ontology rather than objects, although we explicitly do not make sets and objects disjoint, so that there is no conflict in ontological commitments.

This is difficult to name.  FMA alrfeady uses "Subdivision" which is the GALEN term. Therefore we are stuck with division.  The other possible term such as "Generic Part" ends up with saying that the "Right middle lobe of the lung" is a "Generic anatomic part", which is a most unfortunate labelling.</rdfs:comment>

"Anatomical structure, which consists of the maximal set of organ parts so connected to one another that together they constitute a unit of macroscopic anatomy, structurally distinct from other such units. Examples: femur, biceps, liver, heart, skin, tracheobronchial tree, ovary."

Note that the FMA definiton of "Organ" is controversial, and the list of "organs" not agreed by all.  In general this makes little difference, but it does affect the 'view' mechanism and motivate notions such as "clinically part of". The classic controversy is the Pericardium, which is a separate organ from the heart in the FMA and developmentally but considered part of it functionally for many clinical purposes.</rdfs:comment>

Whole organisms as opposed to their bodies.  There is a strong case for identifying Organism with Body, but this is left open at this stage.  As it stands the ontology is compatible either with the view that the body is part of the organism or that the body is the organism.

In many variants of this ontology we shall use Organism where FMA uses Body
FMA Definition:
"Anatomical structure, which is the maximal aggregate manifestation of an individual member of the species Homo sapiens; it is completely surrounded by skin. Examples: There is only one human body."

In other variants of this ontology we shall use "Organism" essentially as a marker for Human, Mouse, Fly, etc. and Body as the structure.</rdfs:comment>

    >Epithelium, connective tissue etc.  

The status of tissue is controversial, also of extended tissues that behave as mass entities such as "skin'.  FMA classifies tissues as "Anatomical Structures" and "Skin" as an organ.  This does not work in this ontology because we want to talk of the "Skin of the Finger" etc. and have it obey the general rule that "The skin of a part is a part of the skin of the whole". 

FMA Definition: 
"Anatomical structure, which consists of similarly specialized cells and intercellular matrix, aggregated according to genetically determined spatial relationships. Examples: epithelium, muscle tissue, connective tissue, neural tissue, lymphoid tissue."

Tissues and biological substances.  

This definition is controversial.  The status of "Tissues" has been a topic of debate for some time.  However, in this ontology, the notion of constituent parts does not work unless we make tissue a mass entity.

The "Amount_of_" prefix becomes cumbersom and will be omitted below this point.  It is also easily confused with the Portion or Quantity.  However, any instance of any mass entity is implicitly of an amount of that entity.</rdfs:comment>

    >Links a symbol to the thing it is a symbol for.  Actually a bit of a cluge, since the symbol is for any member of the class rather than some member of the class.</rdfs:comment>
