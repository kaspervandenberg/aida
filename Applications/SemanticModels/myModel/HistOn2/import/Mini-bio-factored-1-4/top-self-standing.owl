    >The top self-standing entities but not the properties that link them.

This module must import some additional module for properties, either of:
	basic-bio-basic-top-properties.owl - the very simplest unit mostly used for documentation
	basic-bio-top-properties-location-part-whole - the version holding the part-whole hierarchy
No module should import both.
	

At this stage it is a limitation of the tool that superproperties cannot be added to an imported ontology.  Therefore the property trees have to be imported en bloc.</rdfs:comment>

    >Anything made up necessarily of other things.  Includes collectives, groups, and relationships.  Also includes "Qualities".

The label is problematic.  Suggestions happily received.  "Complex" was the original but caused problems for biologists and chemists because of the obvious homononym.  We might just adopt John Sowa's "Seconds and Thirds" as being at least incomprehensible as opposed to being likely to be misunderstood. 

Composed_entities are Self_standing_entities that are not "independent" but take their identity from the things of which they are composed. 


Complexes do not have an opposite, because the notion of Monad is dangerous, as many things can be, arguably, viewed as complexes.   A good commitment to defer.
