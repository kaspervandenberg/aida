Input: annotated text data in XML format as in, e.g.: &lt;doc&gt;In contrast to the genes of the &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-A&lt;/protein&gt;, &lt;protein&gt;MAGE- B&lt;/protein&gt; and &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-C&lt;/protein&gt; clusters, &lt;protein&gt;MAGED2&lt;/protein&gt; is expressed ubiquitously. &lt;/doc&gt;Do not forget to include a root tag &lt;doc&gt; (&lt;document&gt; is also allowed to be a root tag). All other tags are considered to be class labels (such as protein in the example above).

Returns performance given 10-fold cross-validation on the input data. A model is stored in model_file provided by a user. Its log file is created in the same folder using model_file with “.log” appended. Note: a model’s log is always stored in the same folder where a model is stored (if any of these are removed by a user eventual applying of a model on the new data set (testing) by using TestModel service will fail).</s:workflowdescription>

    <s:description>train_set (String) - annotated data in XML file. All tags apart from  (and tags used for annotating structural parts of Medline ) are considered to be class labels.
Example:
&lt;doc&gt;In contrast to the genes of the &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-A&lt;/protein&gt;, &lt;protein&gt;MAGE- B&lt;/protein&gt; and &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-C&lt;/protein&gt; clusters, &lt;protein&gt;MAGED2&lt;/protein&gt; is expressed ubiquitously. &lt;/doc&gt;
Example2 (from http://ws.adaptivedisclosure.org/LearnModel/learn):
&lt;document&gt;TI - Expression pattern and further characterization of human &lt;protein&gt;MAGED2&lt;/protein&gt; and identification of rodent orthologues. AB  - In a search for genes involved in X-linked mental retardation we have analyzed the expression pattern and genomic structure of human &lt;protein&gt;MAGED2&lt;/protein&gt;. This gene is a member of a new defined &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-D&lt;/protein&gt; cluster in Xp11.2, a hot spot for X-linked mental retardation. Rat and mouse orthologues have been isolated. In contrast to the genes of the &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-A&lt;/protein&gt;, &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-B&lt;/protein&gt; and &lt;protein&gt;MAGE-C&lt;/protein&gt; clusters, &lt;protein&gt;MAGED2&lt;/protein&gt; is expressed ubiquitously. High expression was detected in specific brain regions and in the interstitium of testes. Five SNPs in the coding region of human &lt;protein&gt;MAGED2&lt;/protein&gt; were characterized and their allele frequencies determined in a German and Turkish population.&lt;/document&gt;</s:description>
