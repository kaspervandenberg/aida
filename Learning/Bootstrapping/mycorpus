Included are cytosolic proteins such as glycogen synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the inhibitor-2 protein of type-1 protein phosphatase(1) ; cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin, troponin, ankyrin(1) ; membrane-associated proteins such as spectrin, neural cell adhesion molecule(17) , and the insulin receptor; nuclear proteins such as p53 (18) , cAMP response element modulator (CREM)(19) , SV40 large T antigen (20) , and RNA polymerases I and II(21) ; and proteins involved in protein synthesis such as initiation factors 4E(22) , 3, 4B, and 5, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and ribosomal protein S6(1). Those proteins for which there is evidence for phosphorylation at the CKI sites in vivo include glycogen synthase(23) , SV40 large T antigen (24) , cAMP response element modulator(19) , and p53(18) . CKI phosphorylation is known to inhibit glycogen synthase(25) , inhibit DNA replication by SV40 large T antigen(24) , and enhance DNA binding of cAMP response element modulator(19) .

 Iron limitation may have multiple effects on the fungal cell. One likely effect is the reduced activity of proteins that require iron ions as an essential cofactor. This would include iron&#150;sulphur (Fe/S) proteins such as succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase, haem proteins such as peroxidases, oxidases, cytochrome P450, and non-haem and non-Fe/S proteins such as dioxygenase, oxygenase, lipoxygenases and ribonucleotide reductase. The loss of sufficient activities of all these iron-dependent enzymes may cause a defined or cumulative or synergic effect resulting in cell death.

 The relative abundance of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, and proapoptotic proteins, such as Bak, is believed to play a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell life and death (22). It is therefore conceivable that the 50% decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels induced by DHT may be sufficient to disrupt the ratio between Bcl-2 and proapoptotic proteins, thereby rendering ZR-75-1 cells more susceptible to apoptosis. However, the control of apoptosis is far more complex, because other antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, may partially compensate for the decrease in Bcl-2 levels.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Results Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References &nbsp; Identification of secreted and membrane proteins expressed in fetal liver by the signal sequence trap In order to identify surface markers for fetal hepatic cells other than blood cells, we applied the signal sequence trap using the cDNA library of E14.5 hepatic cells deprived of CD45+TER119+ hematopoietic cells. Among various molecules identified by this approach, serum proteins such as AFP and albumin were most frequently found; 40% of the clones obtained comprised cDNAs for these two serum proteins (Table 2). In addition to these clones, we repeatedly isolated cDNA fragments encoding Dlk also known as Pref-1, suggesting that Dlk is one of the most abundant membrane proteins expressed in E14.5 fetal liver. Additional known membrane and secreted proteins identified were carrier proteins such as vitamin D binding protein and retinol binding protein, cytokines such as M-CSF and IGF-II, cytokine receptors such as interferon and lymphotoxin &#223; receptors, proteases such as HGF-activator and plasminogen, and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, vitronectin and nidogen.

 Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are crucially involved in the control of apoptosis (1-3). This family includes anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 itself and an increasing number of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and Bid that translocate to mitochondria and facilitate the release of cytochrome c during the induction of apoptosis (2-7). The pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family can be further divided in multidomain proteins such as Bax and Bak, which share three domains of sequence homology with Bcl-2, and the so-called "BH3-only" proteins such as Bid and Bad, which share a single region of sequence homology with Bcl-2, the BH3 domain (1, 3, 5-10).

 Although integrins are receptors that directly mediate interaction between cells and the substratum, they are only part of the adhesive machinery. On binding to the extracellular matrix, integrins cluster and interact with a variety of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules that link them to basal actin filaments and regulate morphogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation (7, 35). These actin-integrin adhesion complexes contain protein kinases such as Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), adapter proteins such as paxillin, and actin-binding proteins such as talin, vinculin, and -actinin (7, 35, 57). The formation of these multimeric assemblies undoubtedly strengthens overall cell adhesion. For this reason, we considered the possibility that disassembly of basal adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton by ATP depletion might contribute to cell detachment.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis. These proteins share sequence homology in Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains and function to promote or prevent apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL show homology in four BH domains (BH1 to -4). Proapoptotic proteins can be grouped into "multidomain" and "BH3-only" subfamilies. Multidomain proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak display homology in BH domains 1-3, whereas BH3-only proteins such as Bid and Bim are similar structurally to multidomain family members, but sequence similarity is limited to only the BH3 domain. The current model for how Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis involves three sequential processes: (i) BH3-only proteins are activated by various death signals; (ii) the active BH3-only proteins then either activate multidomain proapoptotic proteins or inhibit antiapoptotic proteins or both; and (iii) unless inhibited by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, activated multidomain proapoptotic proteins form oligomers in the mitochondrial outer membrane that release proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The released proteins trigger activation of the caspases and nucleases that eventually dismantle the cell (1-4).

 Ent1 Binds Yeast Membranes in a Ub- and UIM-dependent and Cooperative Fashion-- It has been demonstrated that certain cell-surface transmembrane proteins, such as Ste2 and Ste6, are ubiquitinated as a prerequisite to their internalization (17, 18). Thus, it is possible that these and/or other Ub-modified proteins such as peripheral membrane proteins may act as docking sites for Ub-binding proteins such as Ent1. To test this possibility, we prepared a crude membrane fraction from yeast that contains plasma membrane, which is the major localization site of many endocytic proteins in vivo (Fig. 2A), including the yeast epsins (6). We confirmed by Western blotting that these membranes contained an abundance of Ub-conjugated proteins (Fig. 2A), and tested whether these membranes could recruit recombinant His6-Ent1 in a Ub-dependent manner.

 ColQ binds MuSK trough its COOH terminus Several mouse mutants are characterized by an absence or a reduction in the number of AChE clusters at the synapse. These mutants can be classified in three groups: (1) mutants of the basal lamina proteins such as perlecan; (2) mutants of intrinsic membrane proteins such as dystroglycan and MuSK; and (3) mutants of extrinsic or cytoskeletal proteins such as rapsyn and -syntrophin (for review see Sanes and Lichtman, 2001). For most of these mutants, the absence of AChE clusters can be explained by a perturbation of the ColQ&#150;perlecan-DG scaffold. The perturbation results either from the absence of one of the ColQ partners in the scaffold or from the absence of a key component involved in the assembly of the scaffold, i.e., MuSK. Alternatively, ColQ COOH terminus could directly bind to MuSK.

FasL antagonists (soluble Fas, decoy receptor-3, and even soluble FasL), intracellular proteins such as FLIP (an antagonist of caspase 8), and, in certain cells, other protective proteins such as bclxL, protect from the lethality of FasL [2].

 In concurrence with its role in neuronal development, many of the identified Cdk5 substrates are cytoskeletal proteins such as neurofilament (9), actin-associated proteins such as Pak1 (10), and microtubule-associated proteins such as Map1b (11) and tau (12). Cdk5&#183;p35 also phosphorylates Nudel, which interacts with the LIS1-dynein complex to regulate dynein-mediated axonal transport along microtubules (13). LIS1, the protein product of a gene mutated in lissencephaly, a human neuronal migration defect, can modulate microtubule organization and dynein distribution (14). Nudel, on the other hand, is a LIS1-interacting protein that has sequence homology to gene products implicated in fungal nucleokinesis (15). Both LIS1 and Nudel are enriched in neuronal growth cones (13). Thus, it appears that Cdk5&#183;p35 contributes to the overall neuronal architecture and function through the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics including those of actin, microtubules, and microtubule-associated proteins.

 Disruption of the steady-state distribution of Golgi components by BFA To examine how the steady-state association of the different Golgi proteins is affected under different conditions, we treated cells with BFA, which has a marked effect on the architecture of the Golgi complex. During BFA treatment, coat proteins, such as COPI, dissociate from Golgi membranes and Golgi glycosylation enzymes are redistributed to the ER (Klausner et al., 1992). In addition, recycling proteins, such as ERGIC53/p58 and the p24 family, as well as Golgi matrix proteins, such as GRASP65 and GM130, appear in peripheral structures (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Nakamura et al., 1995; Tang et al., 1995; Blum et al., 1999; Seemann et al., 2000). These structures are often described as Golgi remnants since they are thought to be left behind after BFA-induced ER redistribution of Golgi enzymes (Hendricks et al., 1992; Seemann et al., 2000).

 Other membrane cargo proteins, such as the general amino acid permease (Gap1p), are recognized and packaged by the standard COPII subunits (Kuehn et al. 1996 ). We suggest that such standard passenger proteins are recognized directly or indirectly by Sec24p. Similar considerations apply to anterograde v-SNARE proteins (Springer and Schekman 1998 ) and to mammalian membrane proteins, such as the VSV-G protein (Aridor et al. 1998 ).

 Apoptosis is a physiological process of cell death shared by all multicellular organisms and is critical for removing unwanted cells during development. This process is essential for the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis. Cell death or survival is dependent on the receipt of continuous signals from the extracellular environment. These signals are then transduced through the cell surface to intracellular molecules that regulate apoptotic cell death. A number of such regulators have been identified. Among them, the BCL-2 family proteins play an important role in both induction and suppression of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1). The anti-apoptotic members include the cellular proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, BFL1, and BCL-w and viral proteins such as Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B-19K proteins. These cellular and viral proteins suppress apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli. Certain pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, despite sharing extensive homology with BCL-2, induce apoptosis when overexpressed. Most other pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD, BID, BIK, BIM, BNIP3, BNIP1, HRK, and NOXA share only a single domain (BH3)1 with BCL-2 and are hence designated "BH3-alone" proteins; the human BIK protein is the founding member of this family. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a BH3-alone protein Egl-1 has been shown to be essential for developmentally programmed death of somatic cells (2). An interesting feature of the BCL-2 family of proteins is the ability of the pro-apoptotic members to heterodimerize with the anti-apoptotic members (reviewed in Ref. 1). This suggests that one of the mechanisms by which anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family suppress apoptosis may be through heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic members. However, at least in the case of BIK, heterodimerization with anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL is insufficient for induction of apoptosis (3), suggesting that other factors may also influence the apoptotic activity of BIK.

 Proteins such as ALP and Vam3p that follow the alternative pathway to the vacuole (Cowles et al., 1997; Darsow et al., 1997; Piper et al., 1997) do not transit through the PVC defined by mutations in the class E VPS gene, VPS27 (Fig. 2 C). vps27 mutants accumulate an exaggerated form of the PVC because of a block of traffic out of this compartment both on to the vacuole and back to the TGN (Piper et al., 1995). This class E compartment contains both endocytosed proteins and recycling late-Golgi membrane proteins as well as vacuolar proteins that follow the VPS-dependent, or CPY, pathway to the vacuole (Piper et al., 1995). Vacuolar proteins such as Vph1p and recycling Golgi membrane proteins such as Vps10p, enter the class E compartment in Golgi-derived, Vps45p-controlled transport vesicles (Bryant et al., 1998) while proteins that follow the alternative pathway to the vacuole bypass this compartment (Piper et al., 1997).

 A large number of pro- and anti-apoptotic cellular proteins of the Bcl-2 family regulate cellular apoptosis (14, 15). These proteins contain one or more Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains, which are grouped into four classes: BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4. The BH3 domain interacts with a pocket formed by the BH1 and BH2 domains, thus enabling many of these proteins to homo-and heterodimerize and function as regulators of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and BclxL, and proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains, whereas other proapoptotic proteins, such as Bad, Bid, and Bik, contain the BH3 domain only. The latter proteins are thought to neutralize the anti-apoptotic proteins by forming inactive heterodimers. Here, we report the identification of a new member of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family that contains only the BH3 domain. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES

 The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the permeabilization of MOM. Pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid induce the release of apoptogenic factors, whereas anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent their release. There are two prevailing theories for the permeabilization of the outer membrane. One is that MOM is nonspecifically ruptured; the other proposes the formation of channels that allow cytochrome c release (6, 7).

Several of the proteins (such as RanBP2) are involved in either ubiquitination or SUMOylation, whereas many others appear to be involved in RNA metabolism. Thus, in a number of cases, the putative zinc-binding motif is directly C-terminal to a known RNA recognition motif, such as an RRM domain (47), and proteins such as ZNF265 contain other elements associated with splicing, such as RS domains (48).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References &nbsp; Mitosis is a highly regulated process characterized by dramatic and coordinated morphological changes to ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Cytokinesis occurs at the final stage of mitosis and is accomplished by the contraction of an acto-myosin ring that leads to daughter cell separation at the midbody (Cao and Wang, 1990). A number of proteins accumulate at the midzone of the mammalian mitotic spindle during late mitosis and have been shown to play a role in cell cleavage by antibody suppression, overexpression, or mutagenesis. Among these proteins are passenger proteins such as INCENP (Mackay et al., 1998) and survivin (Skoufias et al., 2000; Uren et al., 2000); protein kinases such as polo (Lee et al., 1995) and aurora B (Terada et al., 1998); small G-proteins such as Rho (Takada et al., 1996; Drechsel et al., 1997; O'Connell et al., 1999); and microtubule motor proteins such as CENP-E (Yen et al., 1992; Martineau-Thuillier et al., 1998), Rab6-KIFL (Hill et al., 2000), and MKLP1 (Sellitto and Kuriyama, 1988; Nislow et al., 1992). Some interactions among these proteins have been established, but specifically defined functional roles in the cleavage process are still largely unknown. Another protein that accumulates in the spindle midzone and that has a demonstrated role in sustaining cell cleavage, PRC1, has been recently described (Jiang et al., 1998). As is true of most of the other midzone proteins, the precise role of PRC1 in the cleavage process is unknown.

 RIBP is a complex adaptor protein. The gene encodes a PRR that may bind SH3 domain&#150;containing proteins such as other Src family kinases and other adaptor proteins. In addition, a tyrosine-phosphorylated NPIY sequence present in RIBP may bind PTB domain&#150;containing proteins such as Shc. Proteins such as Shc have been implicated in TCR signal transduction via interactions with ZAP-70 (43) and Cbl, an adaptor which is thought to negatively regulate ZAP-70 activation (44) (45) and binds to the SH3 domain of Itk. The tyrosine-based protein binding motifs present in RIBP (YXXP and YXXV) may bind the SH2 domains of rasGAP, Abl, Crk, and SHP-2, molecules previously shown to regulate T cell signal transduction. Finally, RIBP contains an SH2 domain that may be involved in binding to other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. In this regard, preliminary results indicate that the SH2 domain of RIBP is required for interaction with Rlk, whereas the PRR and tyrosine-based protein binding motifs are unnecessary (our unpublished observations).

In addition, there are many new proteins for which yet no function is known, such as, for instance, the PsbP domain proteins.

 In conclusion, heterologous outer membrane and periplasmic proteins, such as Ail and periplasmic GFP, are packaged in vesicles and can be used to modify the characteristics of the vesicle. Outer membrane and external proteins such as Ail and LT can be used to direct the interactions of vesicles with eukaryotic cells, and GFP and other lumenal vesicle cargo can be used to track soluble transported cargo. Together, these tools provide valuable methods to study the nature of vesicle-mediated transport.

 Transit through the PVC appears to be controlled by a different set of VPS genes, the class E VPS genes (Raymond et al., 1992). Cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of one of these class E genes, VPS27, rapidly and reversibly accumulate cycling Golgi proteins (such as Vps10p), endocytosed proteins (such as Ste3p), and vacuolar proteins in a large, exaggerated form of the PVC (termed the "class E" compartment) (Piper et al., 1995). The accumulation of the prevacuolar compartments into the characteristic class E compartment results from the decreased ability of proteins to depart this compartment and either to move on to the vacuole or to return to the Golgi (Raymond et al., 1992; Piper et al., 1995). Together, the vps45 and vps27 mutations can be used to define intermediates that lie along the vacuolar biogenesis pathway from the late Golgi to the vacuole and that are responsible for the delivery of soluble hydrolases such as CPY as well as membrane proteins such as Vph1p (a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase).

 A number of genes active in granulocytes have been intensively studied as to the function of their products and their expression controls. However, the intensities and relative order of these gene activities have not been studied. This report describes an expression profile of 748&nbsp;different species of active genes in human peripheral granulocytes obtained by analyzing a 3-directed cDNA library that faithfully represents the mRNA population in the source cells. A significant fraction (20.3% of the total) of the expressed genes in granulocytes consisted of nuclear proteins such as DNA binding proteins, of secretory proteins such as cytokines, and of membrane proteins such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and receptors. By comparing this expression profile with 11&nbsp;profiles similarly obtained with unrelated human cells/tissues, we discovered 10&nbsp;novel genes that are likely to act specifically in granulocytes. Comparison of this expression profile with that obtained with granulocytoids widely used as a granulocyte model by inducing a cultured promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 showed similarities and dissimilarities of gene expressions.

 Fascin increases F-actin elasticity at levels well below those observed in living cells (14) and does not help F-actin resist shear stresses of large magnitude. -Actinin greatly enhances the elasticity, resilience, and strain hardening property of F-actin, but not nearly as effectively as -actinin supplemented with fascin. Our results therefore suggest that cells combine bona fide F-actin bundling proteins such as fascin and bona fide cross-linking proteins such as -actinin to produce stiff and resilient cytoskeletal structures.

 Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of PI 3-kinase activation in PH domain-mediated translocation of a number of signaling proteins, such as PLC1, Btk, Akt, Grp1, etc. (7, 13-16). Other findings have suggested that PH domains of some proteins can bind to membrane proteins such as the subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (29). The data reported here demonstrate that the activity of PLC1 is also regulated by PI 3-kinase, possibly by its product PtdIns(3)P, and by the G subunits.

 RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES. RTKs mediate a variety of cellular growth responses. Ligand binding to the RTK results in activation of an intrinsic kinase, which in turn results in autophosphorylation and formation of new binding sites (e.g., for SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains). This results in RTK binding of adapter proteins, such as SHC, or tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins, such as Src, PLC-1, and PI3K. RTK may also be activated by a variety of nonligand stimuli, such as ROS (235), and ultraviolet radiation (178).

 Previous studies on insulin&#146;s effect on liver protein synthesis have reported conflicting results (12,2122232425). In human studies, insulin infusion alone has been shown to decrease splanchnic protein synthesis in nondiabetic (26) and type 1 diabetic (27) individuals. However, insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients has been shown to increase gut mucosal protein synthesis (28), suggesting that most of the changes related to insulin in the splanchnic bed take place in the liver. It is also clear that although insulin replacement may stimulate synthesis of some liver proteins, such as albumin (23), synthesis of other liver proteins, such as fibrinogen, are inhibited (6). The precise role of amino acids versus insulin on liver protein synthesis also remains uncertain (12,22232425,29). To clearly define the role of insulin in regulating the synthesis rate of liver proteins, we used amino acyl&#150;tRNA to measure the synthesis rates of both liver tissue proteins and liver secretory proteins such as albumin and fibrinogen. We specifically determined the effect of insulin alone and insulin plus amino acids on the synthesis rates of these liver proteins.

 Experiments to examine the role of the intracellular environment in protein folding involved the renaturation of proteins such as RNase (2), bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)1 (5), or influenza hemagglutinin (6) in isolated microsomal fractions. The results indicated that protein folding can be facilitated by proteins contained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. In the case of disulfide bond-containing proteins such as BPTI (5) or the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)- subunit (7), the key ER protein involved appears to be protein disulfide isomerase (see below).

 PTP is a nonspecific pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane formed with the critical constituents of both inner membrane proteins, such as adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and cyclophilin D, and outer membrane proteins, such as porin (voltage-dependent anion channel) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family have been demonstrated to be present in the outer membrane and to regulate the PTP during stress. The impermeability of the PTP is thus essential to maintenance of the normal functioning of the cell (33, 26, 29).

 Infection of erythrocytes with the protozoan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is accompanied by many profound changes in the host cell. Membrane permeability to a wide range of organic and inorganic substrates, including amino acids, choline and Ca2+, is selectively increased (for review, see Elford et al20 ). Lipid composition21 and fluidity is altered and the cell loses its deformability and discoid shape.22 The external surface of the cell is also radically altered. As the infection progresses, the smooth surface of the cell becomes dotted with knob-like protusions, which are the location of expression of novel, parasite derived proteins, such as the Pfemp1 family of variant antigens,23-25 and modified host proteins, such as band 3.26 Inside the erythrocyte, several host proteins, including band 4.1, show increased phosphorylation.27-30 Parasite encoded kinases undoubtedly contribute to these changes and a number have now been identified.31-35 However, host cell kinases have been implicated in P falciparum invasion of erythrocytes36 and in the transport of parasite proteins, such as the ring-stage-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA),37,38 to the surface of the RBC.

The observation that p21 can dissociate the p50-PCNA complex suggests that the PCNA-binding motif of p50 targets the same site on PCNA as p21.

 Taken together, we propose that these data lend further support to a model where mRNAs are packaged co-transcriptionally by proteins such as Npl3p and Cbp80/20p. It is possible that the binding of the CBC to the cap structure of mRNAs as they are being synthesized promotes the binding of other mRNA-binding proteins such as Npl3p (Fig. 6). These and other proteins then leave the nucleus together with the mRNA and are released in the cytoplasm, where they rapidly return to the nucleus for another round of packaging and export.

 The epidermis provides an essential protective barrier against the environment. As a stratified squamous epithelium, some inner basal cells become committed to terminal differentiation and move outward to form spinous, granular, and eventually fully differentiated, dead cornified layers. During this migration and differentiation program, unique sets of biochemical markers including specific structural proteins, such as keratins, their associated proteins, and processing enzymes, are synthesized (1-3). Another characteristic feature is the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE),1 which is crucial for barrier function of the epidermis (4). The CE is a highly insoluble structure and contains a complex mixture of specific proteins such as involucrin, loricrin, small proline-rich proteins, XP-5 family members, cystatin A, elafin, S100 family members, and lipids that are covalently cross-linked by transglutaminases (5-10). The quantitatively major CE protein in normal epidermis is loricrin (6, 10). However, the loricrin-deficient mouse model shows only minor defects in barrier function (11), probably because other CE proteins such as small proline-rich proteins, XP-5 proteins, and repetin are up-regulated late during fetal development and apparently compensate for the loss of loricrin (12).

 The numerous proteins that have been reported to interact with GroEL to date display a range of characteristics that are not easily classified in a clear-cut manner; among them are proteins such as lysozyme (36), RNase T1 (37), -lactalbumin (38), and barnase (39), whose folding pathways are affected by a transient interaction with GroEL; proteins such as tryptophanase (15) and LDH (24), which display an initial low spontaneous yield which increases in the presence of GroEL and ATP and the absence of GroES; and proteins such as rhodanese (9) and Rubisco (10), which are tightly bound to GroEL during folding and whose requirements for a successful folding reaction depend on the conditions of refolding (17). Each group of proteins reflects a potential mechanism by which GroEL may interact with various protein species in the actual cellular environment and, as such, must be studied in order to achieve a unified mechanism that explains the myriad interactions between GroEL and folding protein molecules. The results shown in the present study suggest that an additional level of complexity may be found in the mechanism of GroEL-facilitated protein folding, and this idea definitely warrants further study. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

 Several protein families have been reported to modify lipid rafts structurally and functionally. These include integral membrane proteins such as caveolins and flotillins, exoplasmic glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-linked proteins such as Thy-1 and alkaline phosphatase, and receptor tyrosine kinases among others (9). Caveolin integration into the microenvironment of a lipid raft leads to raft invagination and formation of caveolae (9-11). Caveolae are formed in many cell types including endothelial cells (12), and they may play a role in modulation of cell signaling. One hypothesis suggests that interactions of caveolins with signaling molecules regulate their activation status.

 SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS ARISE from diverse populations of precursor cells during embryonic development, and the mechanisms that specify the smooth muscle cell phenotype in each of these populations of cells are largely unknown. All differentiated smooth muscle is characterized by the presence of unique isoforms of contractile proteins such as smooth muscle - and -actin, myosin heavy chain, caldesmon, SM22, telokin, and calponin that are not expressed in other tissue types. Analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of several smooth muscle proteins has revealed distinct patterns of expression of these proteins in different smooth muscle tissues (10, 14, 17-19, 24). The functional significance of these unique patterns of expression is largely unknown. This is partly because the physiological functions of proteins such as telokin, SM22, and calponin are not well established and partly because the unique functions of contractile protein isoforms such as the smooth muscle - and -actins are not well understood. In our efforts to understand the transcriptional regulation and function of telokin, we previously demonstrated that its expression is restricted to smooth muscle tissues, where it is expressed at high levels in visceral smooth muscle tissues and lower levels in vascular tissues (6, 10).

 DEK introduces positive supercoils into topologically fixed circular DNA substrates. This reaction is specific, because other DNA binding proteins such as the SV40 T-Ag or histone binding proteins such as NAP1 do not change the topology of DNA at the same molar ratios (data not shown). The conclusion that DEK introduces positive supercoils into the DNA is based on the following observations. First, we found that the DEK-induced change in topology is reversible after removal of DEK by eukaryotic but not bacterial topoisomerase I.&nbsp;Second, analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis directly showed the presence of positive supercoils.

 The septic leukocyte phenotype has also been well documented in experimentally induced septic cell lines including human promonocytic THP-1 cells (10) as well as the murine RAW264.7 and HeNC2 macrophage cells (11). Upon initial LPS treatment, proinflammatory cytokines are rapidly induced within these cells. Mimicking human blood leukocytes from septic patients, prolonged treatment of THP-1 cells with LPS induces an adapted state as reflected by the suppression of proinflammatory proteins such as IL-1 and TNF-. Upon further LPS treatment, LPS-adapted THP-1 cells exhibit continued production of anti-inflammatory proteins such as sIL-1RA (7).

Moreover, group A streptococci can capture plasmin(ogen) indirectly through fibrinogen which in turn binds to M-like proteins (15). Such a multiplicity of interactions with the key player of the fibrinolytic pathway suggests that the plasmin(ogen)-binding property carries a selective advantage to streptococci, motivating an analysis of the relative importance and biological role of the different mechanisms.

 One key group of intracellular factors regulating apoptosis is the Bcl-2 family of proteins (12). The members of this family can be subdivided into antiapoptotic proteins (such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and proapoptotic proteins (such as Bax and BAD). It has been proposed that anti- and proapoptotic proteins regulate cell death by binding to each other and forming heterodimers (13, 14). According to this model, a delicate balance between anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members exists in each cell, and the relative concentrations of these two groups of proteins determine whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.

 Protein prenyltransferases catalyze C-terminal post-translational lipid modification of a variety of proteins, including small GTP-binding proteins (1, 2). This modification is necessary for the proper cellular membrane localization and function of these proteins. Three similar but distinct prenyltransferases have been characterized: protein farnesyltransferase (FTase),1 protein geranylgeranyltransferases I and II (GGTase I and GGTase II) (1, 2). FTase recognizes the C-terminal CAAX motif (where C represents cysteine, A is aliphatic amino acid, and X is preferentially methionine, cysteine, serine, alanine, or glutamine) present in substrate proteins such as Ras and the -subunits of yeast heterotrimeric G-protein and transducin. GGTase I recognizes the CAAL motif (similar to the CAAX motif except the C-terminal residue is leucine or phenylalanine) present in proteins such as Rho1 and Cdc42. FTase and GGTase I are both heterodimers of - and -subunits and share a common -subunit. Unlike FTase and GGTase I, GGTase II contains a third subunit in addition to the / heterodimer and prenylates proteins such as Rab family small GTPases, which end with CC or CXC. The three-dimensional structures of the rat FTase as well as FTase complexed with its substrates have recently been solved by x-ray crystallography (3-5).

 What limits are there to detecting DNA-binding activities with pentaprobe? Current results from independent studies together with the data shown here suggest that in vitro most DNA-binding proteins, including those of the classical zinc finger, Ets domain and treble clef finger classes tested here, will recognise short DNA motifs of 5 bp or less. Other highly represented proteins, such as homeodomain proteins, are also known to contact short motifs and it is likely that they too will bind pentaprobe. In general, we expect that most if not all monomeric eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins will display detectable binding to pentaprobe, at least under the conditions used here (i.e. in the presence of relatively high concentrations of protein). It is possible that some proteins, such as those that bind as homodimers to elongated recognition sites, may not show binding to pentaprobe. For example, nuclear receptors often bind to sites composed of a pair of (often degenerate) 6 bp repeats, sometimes separated by 3 bp and sometimes inverted (12). The full set of such sequences is not contained in pentaprobe. Nevertheless, it has been reported that nuclear receptors can function through so-called &#145;half-sites&#146; (13) and it is possible that binding would be detected in vitro. Other dimeric proteins, such as leucine zipper proteins, typically bind repeated 3 bp sites but binding is still observed when one residue is mutated. Hence, we would expect that at least some leucine zipper proteins would bind pentaprobe. It is notable that the Ikaros family proteins, such as Eos, can homodimerise, and dimerisation is thought to enhance DNA-binding activity. The portion of Eos used in our experiments lacks the dimerisation domain and so exists only as a monomer but nevertheless displays strong binding to pentaprobe, indicating that binding by monomer subunits can be detected by this method.

 The insufficient function of O-linked glycans of DPPIV as an apical sorting signal is probably due to their spreading over the ectodomain of DPPIV. Proteins such as SI and the neurotrophin receptor possess Ser/Thr-rich stalk domains in which O-glycans are clustered permitting an efficient access to multivalent binding proteins, such as lectins (29, 30). A high binding affinity of a putative lectin receptor to the O-glycans of DPPIV would not be expected. This would also explain the auxiliary role and the requirement of the complex N-glycans containing galactose residues in the binding to the putative receptor.

 As shown in Table I, the largest general functional category (19 proteins) includes enzymes that catalyze post-translational modification of proteins, such as kinases [e.g. in Figure 1, see increased expression of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and MEK2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2)], phosphatases, farnesylating and ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. We have also indicated pathways in which some of these proteins are active in Figure 2 (and some of these proteins and pathways are discussed at greater length in the Supplementary Material Online). The next largest class (17 proteins) includes structural proteins such as those involved in cytoskeleton and microtubule assembly. The next functional groups in Table I are regulatory proteins such as transcription factors (11 proteins), DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control (10 proteins), and proteins employed in lysosomes, Golgi, endocytosis and exocytosis (10 proteins). The remaining 24 proteins were distributed into 10 functional classes. The number of proteins (n = 82) that behaved consistently in the selected lines is much greater than those that behaved inconsistently (n = 9). This observation agrees with the expectation that the over- or under-expression of proteins in the resistant lines should ordinarily be causally related to the apoptosis-resistance phenotype rather than being a random change.

 Unlike other cell surface proteins, such as the transferrin receptor, CYP2E1 and its variants were not uniformly distributed over the PM but instead located at discrete patches on the cell surface. It is well documented that certain proteins, such as influenza virus hemagglutinin, are found at discrete patches on the PM, also called rafts, which are structures consisting of sphingolipids and cholesterol with associated proteins (40). The reason for the clustered PM distribution of CYP2E1 is not known, but a similar pattern has been observed for PM-localized CYP2E1 in constitutive FGC4 cells and in V79 cells stably transfected with CYP2E1 cDNA (22).

 The interaction between Bcl-2 family proteins is obviously important for coupling apoptotic signals to the alteration of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Three-dimensional structures of monomeric antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and CED-9 as well as proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid have been determined (5-12). A hydrophobic surface groove common to the structures of all of the antiapoptotic proteins is encircled by five helices (helices 2-5 and 8) and connecting loops. The equivalent hydrophobic groove in the multidomain proapoptotic protein Bax is occluded by its C-terminal hydrophobic helix (helix 9). Although the overall structure is similar, the BH3-only protein Bid does not contain this hydrophobic groove. Further, a complementary hydrophobic surface that would interact with the hydrophobic groove is not obvious in the structures of monomeric Bcl-2 family proteins, making modeling of a dimeric complex difficult (13). However, one possible interface for the heterodimer between anti- and proapoptotic proteins has been deduced from structures of Bcl-xL in complex with a BH3 domain peptide from a proapoptotic protein such as Bak, Bad, or Bim (14-16). In all of these complex structures, the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-xL binds the peptide as an -helix.

 Focal adhesion sites are perhaps the most widely studied regions for mechanotransduction. Morphologically, these sites undergo significant dynamic remodeling resulting in realignment in the direction of flow (12, 20). Acutely, shear activation of integrins leads to phosphorylation of focal complex proteins such as paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which facilitate focal adhesion remodeling (24). Cytosolic proteins such as Fyn and Shc are also recruited to integrin sites to initiate signal transduction cascades, ultimately resulting in downstream transcription (7, 26). These pathways are further potentiated through cross talk with tyrosine kinase receptors and small G proteins coordinating gene transcription and cytoskeletal remodeling (46, 48).

 Phylogenetically conserved Bcl-2 family proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis from virus to human (1). Members of the Bcl-2 family consist of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, and proapoptotic proteins such as BAD, Bax, BOD, and Bok. It has been proposed that anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate cell death by binding to each other and forming heterodimers (2). A delicate balance between anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members exists in each cell and the relative concentration of these two groups of proteins determines whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.

 In addition to the activation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerol and the mobilization of intracellular calcium by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphoinositide metabolites contribute to other cellular activities that may be relevant to TNF signaling. The binding of PIP2 to pleckstrin homology domains may influence localization of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to the membrane. PIP2 binds to cytoskeletal proteins such as gelsolin and profilin that can influence cytoskeletal remodeling (33). Also, clathrin coat-associated proteins, such as AP-2, bind avidly to inositol polyphosphates (34). In the case of AP-2, the binding of inositol phosphate blocks its clathrin coat assembly properties.

 THE cytoskeleton plays an important role in establishing structural and functional specializations at sites of cell-cell contact. For instance, at the postsynaptic density, cytoskeletal proteins participate in a complex that localizes receptors and ion channels for efficient signal transduction (Cho et al., 1992; Kornau et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1996; Dong et al., 1997; Srivastava et al., 1998). In polarized epithelia, membrane specializations form tight junctions (TJs)1 which separate the apical and basolateral membranes, and function as barriers to diffusion across the epithelium (Gumbiner, 1987). Proteins such as ZO-1 are highly localized at the TJ (Stevenson et al., 1986) where they are thought to anchor transmembrane proteins, such as occludin (Furuse et al., 1994; Fanning et al., 1998). Similar multiprotein complexes have been described for the apical and basolateral membranes where transmembrane proteins, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and the proteoglycan, syndecan, are linked to the actin cytoskeleton (Cohen et al., 1998; Short et al., 1998). Finally, in skeletal muscle, the cytoskeletal protein, dystrophin, anchors transmembrane and signaling proteins at the neuromuscular junction (Colledge and Froehner, 1998). Although expressed in different cell types, these complexes share the common ability to serve as a scaffold on which transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins assemble.

 Our results suggest that mammalian p55CDC is used at metaphase and anaphase to target several substrates. This result is in agreement with the latest genetic studies from yeast, demonstrating that a single targeting protein such as Cdc20 may be involved in the ubiquitination of several specific substrates by the APC at appropriate stages of cell division. Other Cdc20-like proteins such as Hct1/Cdh1 and Fizzy-related appear to be required at G1 when no Cdc20 is present. However, at present we cannot formally eliminate the possibility that anti-p55CDC antibody injection into PtK1 cells also affects related members of the mammalian family of Cdc20 proteins.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Upon translocation into gastric epithelial cells, CagA localizes to the plasma membrane, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at EPIYA sites so as to generate docking sites for cellular proteins such as SHP-2 and Csk (31). Both SHP-2 and Csk are cytoplasmic proteins, and they are activated upon membrane recruitment. Accordingly, membrane localization is an essential prerequisite for CagA to deregulate intracellular signaling. CagA also associates with tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and JAM, and disturbs junctional functions (27). Again, in this case, membrane localization is crucial for CagA to interact with junctional complexes.

 Interleukin (IL)1-3 is a cytokine that acts on early bone marrow-derived hematopoietic precursors, inducing their growth and differentiation into cells of the myeloid, lymphoid, and erythoid lineages (1). Withdrawal of IL-3 from dependent cell lines leads to cell death, with the activation of caspases and DNA fragmentation as late events (2). Inhibition of cell death is partly through up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (3, 4), and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad (5). However, the metabolic changes that serve as initiating conditions for cytokine withdrawal-induced death are not fully understood.

 That a mutation in a membrane protein, such as NHE, leads to seizure activity is not surprising. Indeed, a number of mutations in various membrane protein genes, such as the Ca2+ channel -subunit (Cchb4) or the voltage-gated K+ channel subunit (Kv1.1), have been shown to produce convulsions (1, 5, 6, 10, 25). Furthermore, mutations in ion channel proteins, including the voltage-sensitive Na+ channel and a Ca2+ channel (CACNA1A), have been identified to cause myotonia and ataxia (2, 23). Of interest to this work is that the ataxia of humans suffering from a mutation in CACNA1A is responsive to acetazolamide and pH changes (2).

 Activators of c-Src include cell surface proteins such as integrins and growth factor receptors (reviewed in Refs. 2 and 16). The combined overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor with c-Src is sufficient to promote increased c-Src PTK activity and the transformation of normal fibroblasts (17, 18). In the case of integrins, which do not possess catalytic activity, overexpression of integrin-associated signaling proteins such as the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can interact with and enhance c-Src PTK activity (19). In normal cells, FAK and c-Src association and activation occur in a transient fashion, and both events are tightly regulated. Upon integrin stimulation, the c-Src SH2 domain binds to the motif surrounding a major autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397) on FAK (20, 21). The formation of this FAK-Src complex enhances FAK PTK activity (22), and Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-925 promotes Grb2 adaptor protein binding to FAK (21, 23). The combined Src-FAK signaling complex also promotes the enhanced phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as Shc and p130Cas (24, 25). Downstream targets that are activated by this Src-FAK complex include the ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascades as well as phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and Akt (reviewed in Ref. 16).

 Fas. &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Patients and methods Results Discussion References &nbsp; Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, balances the cellular arm of the immune system. Appropriate regulation of the survival and deletion of immune cells allows necessary defence reactions and prevents self-damage. Apoptosis is therefore an essential mechanism to regulate the immune response and to maintain immunological tolerance [1, 2]. Intracellular check-points with protective proteins such as Bcl-2 [3] and death proteins such as Bax [4] are involved in controlling apoptosis. In addition, immune cells express death receptors such as the CD95 (Fas) receptor, which, if engaged, can also start the apoptosis cascade [5&#150;7].

 Here we presented a general approach for producing soluble divalent versions of heterodimeric proteins such as T cell receptors. This is the first time that soluble high affinity and specificity analogues of TCR proteins have been made. This approach is not only of relevance for TCR, but also for other immunoregulatory proteins such as class II MHC molecules (O'Herrin, S.M., M.S. Lebowitz, and J.P. Schneck, manuscript in preparation), and potentially useful in other cell biological systems involving heterodimeric integral membrane proteins. The experimental system described here outlines a general approach of using divalent high affinity ligands to study cell-cell interactions, driven by multivalent ligand-receptor interactions.

 The AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2 contain type I and type II PDZ binding motifs, respectively, that interact with different sets of proteins to regulate the synaptic expression of AMPARs (4). Although the C-terminal (ct)-GluR1 interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as SAP97 (5, 6), the extreme C-terminal ct-GluR2 interacts with PDZ domain proteins such as protein interacting with protein kinase C (PICK1) (7, 8), the glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) (9), and AMPAR-binding protein (ABP) (10). N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 also bind ct-GluR2 via a non-PDZ interactions (4, 11&#150;14).

 As a catalyst, PDI must deal with different mechanisms for directing disulfide formation. With some proteins, such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the specification of cysteine connectivity occurs early in folding and is directed by the formation of native-like structures that are interconverted by intramolecular disulfide rearrangements (3). With other proteins, such as ribonuclease A (RNase), the identification of which cysteines to connect occurs late in folding resulting in a large collection of intermediates with random disulfides and substantial non-native structure that must be rearranged to give native connectivity (4). PDI is capable of accelerating folding that proceeds by either of these mechanisms (5, 9).

 Geldanamycin induces the metabolic degradation of other protein kinases, such as Raf and Src. In the case of Raf, in particular, the geldanamycin-binding protein Hsp90 along with another protein p50cdc37 interact with the raf kinase domain (36, 37). It seems likely that a geldanamycin-binding protein, perhaps Hsp90, also interacts with the ErbB-2 kinase domain and, in the absence of geldanamycin, assists in the maintenance of this kinase domain in an active conformation. Given the intracellular abundance of proteins such as Hsp90, this interaction could be of low affinity and not readily detected by assays such as co-immunoprecipitation. Additional experiments will explore this issue. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Further characterization of HCMV-peptide epitopes for other HCMV proteins, such as pp150 and IE1, with the approach described here will help to further improve our understanding of protective HCMV immunity.

 The ubiquitin pathway is the major non-lysosomal protein degradation pathway in eukaryotes. It is responsible for the proteolysis of a wide variety of cellular proteins including important short-lived regulatory proteins such as p53, I-B, c-Myc, c-Fos, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (reviewed in Refs. 1-4). Another crucial function of this pathway is the elimination of misfolded or denatured proteins such as those that arise in cases of heat shock or other forms of cellular stress (5). Proteins are targeted for destruction by the addition of a polyubiquitin chain and then degraded by a large multisubunit protease known as the 26&nbsp;S proteasome.

 The ability of integrin ligation to suppress apoptosis is well established, and several different mechanisms have been reported, reflecting a degree of cell type and integrin specificity (for review see Jost et al., 2001; Miranti and Brugge, 2002). Ligation of integrins can induce antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 (Matter and Ruoslahti, 2001), or suppress proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax (Gilmore et al., 2000; Valentijn et al., 2003). Ligation of 5&#223;1 or v&#223;3 increases Bcl-2 expression through NFB activation (Scatena et al., 1998). Integrin activation of FAK leads to increased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, which bind to and inhibit executioner caspases (Sonoda et al., 2000).

These proteins have in common highly conserved cysteines, which are particularly sensitive to reactive oxygen species and are easily modified both in vitro and in vivo. Upon modification of the cysteine residues, proteins such as Hsp33 (2), protein kinase C (15), and OxyR (16) are activated, while proteins like PTEN (17) are inactivated. Other redox-regulated protein display altered affinity to regulatory partner proteins such as sigma factors (e.g. RsrA (18)) or nuclear export factors (e.g. Yap1p (19)) depending on their redox status.

Several studies have been dedicated to the analysis of conserved water positions in different biological systems, whether they were devoted to different crystal structures of the same protein, such as the serine protease family (Rashin et al., 1986; Williams et al., 1994) or to related proteins, such as the microbial RNases (Sreenivasan and Axelsen, 1992; Zhang and Matthews, 1994; Sanschagrin and Kuhn, 1998; Ogata and Wodak, 2002). All of these studies demonstrated that water plays a pivotal role in most biological systems, by facilitating reactions, stabilizing three-dimensional structures or mediating interactions between proteins and ligands.

However, as far as we are aware, the present findings are the first clear illustration of a lytic effect of a viral protein such as HIV-1 PR on yeast. These data might also prove useful for the development of a yeast-based model to test the lytic ability of other proteins derived from animal viruses. Furthermore, this potential of yeast genetics raises the possibility of searching for one or more genes whose overexpression may suppress HIV-1 PR-mediated cytolysis.

No immunoprecipitable translation products of any of the proteins found to be absent in the doxycycline-grown psg1-regulatable cells could be detected (Fig. 12, A and B). This includes mitochondrial encoded proteins, such as Cox2p, as well as the single nuclear encoded protein found absent, Cox4p. The translation and proper processing of these proteins upon import into mitochondria were found normal in wild type cells. Other nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins, such as aconitase, were translated, imported, and processed as expected in psg1 cells (Fig. 12C).

 Neutrophil elastase (NE)() is an essential component of the phagocytic machinery of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This 30-kDa serine proteinase is a cationic glycoprotein formed of 218 amino acid residues with 19 arginines but no lysines (1) . X-ray crystallographic studies show that the arginine residues are all located in patches at the surface of the protein (2, 3) . NE has a number of physiologic functions including proteolysis of phagocytosed proteins, neutrophil migration, and tissue remodelling following injury (4). It also cleaves extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin, interstitial and type IV collagens, proteoglycans, laminin, and fibronectin as well as plasma proteins such as antithrombin, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, and components of the complement system (5).

 Although a large fraction of the cell surface proteins are found in the liquid disordered regions, some proteins preferentially partition into the ordered raft domains. Typical examples include the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are attached to the outer leaflet of the membrane via the GPI anchor (Chatterjee and Mayor, 2001); the Src-family tyrosine kinases (e.g. Lck, Fyn and Lyn), which are anchored to the inner leaflet via their dual acylation modification (Simons and Toomre, 2000); palmitoylated and myristoylated proteins such as flotillins (Rajendran et al., 2003); cholesterol-binding proteins such as caveolins (Kurzchalia and Parton, 1999) and hedgehog (Karpen et al., 2001); heterotrimeric G proteins; and phospholipid-binding proteins such as annexins (Babiychuk et al., 2002). One morphologically identifiable raft structure is the caveola (Kurzchalia and Parton, 1999). Caveolae are flask-shaped membrane invaginations found in the plasma membranes of several types of cell enriched in their scaffolding proteins, caveolins. Overexpression of these proteins in cells lacking caveolae, such as lymphocytes and neuronal cells, can induce the formation of caveolae (Fra et al., 1995), and targeted disruption of caveolin 1 in mice leads to the disappearance of morphologically recognisable caveolae. Flotillins are non-caveolar proteins that localise to microdomains and probably function as raft organisers. Annexins have also been reported to organise rafts in a calcium-dependent fashion.

 Characterization of GST-Ddyn(PRD) in Rat Brain Cytosol Extracts-- When a protein such as dynamin is known to have a role in synaptic vesicle recycling, the fusion protein overlay (or far-Western) technique can be used to identify additional interacting proteins that may mediate recycling. The identification of binding partners for proteins enriched in the mammalian nerve terminal has focused on SH3-containing proteins, such as Grb2 and amphiphysin, that bind proline-rich domains present in synaptojanin and dynamin (20-26). A subset of the SH3-containing proteins identified by a polyproline peptide phage display screen (27) has been shown to bind to synaptojanin and is implicated in binding to dynamin (23, 24).

In addition, some cell surface proteins, such as Notch, have the same motif. Not surprisingly, the polyglutamine tracts in triplet repeat disease gene products appear structurally identical to those in trans-criptional proteins based on antibody recognition (26).

 Contrasting the BALF and plasma protein expression profile in normal subjects with the EF and plasma protein profile in ALI patients underscores several changes that contribute to the pathology of ALI. First, there is loss of size selectivity of the alveolar-capillary barrier such that high-molecular mass proteins including albumin, transferrin, and immunoglobulin leak from plasma into the air spaces (25). Recent studies of ceruloplasmin and albumin in ALI patients have implicated plasma exudation as the source of these proteins (3). In the current investigation the BALF from normal subjects had relatively lower intensity of high-molecular mass proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulin, and transferrin compared with low-molecular mass proteins such as transthyretin. The ALI patients had a relative increase in the intensity of high-molecular mass proteins in their EF. This confirms the integrity and size selectivity of the alveolar-capillary barrier in normal subjects compared with ALI patients. Second, alveolar type II cell function may be impaired during ALI. This observation would account for the relative decreases in EF SP-A that were observed in this and other studies (8, 21). Third, there may be enhanced proteolytic activity in the EF of ALI patients (11, 49, 64). Interestingly, this did not appear to affect all proteins equally; for instance, haptoglobin and 1-AT had observed molecular masses that were significantly less than calculated, yet other proteins remained intact. Fourth, ALI and other inflammatory diseases have been associated with increases in acute-phase proteins (19). We found that there are relative increases in intensity of several acute-phase proteins (such as serum amyloid A and 1-AT) in both the EF and plasma of ALI patients. These findings are consistent with results from previous investigations that examined the association between ALI and individual acute-phase proteins such as ceruloplasmin, albumin, and 2-macroglobulin (3) and surfactant proteins (8), as well as a previous study of crossed immunoelectrophoresis of sera from 15 normal subjects and 10 ALI patients (16).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References &nbsp; The survival of cells of the nervous system is dependent on the action of neurotrophic factors that prevent both intrinsic and extrinsic cues from inducing cellular apoptosis. In developing peripheral neurons, neurotrophic target-derived factors, such as NGF, retrogradely determine neuronal survival by suppressing autocrine and p75NTR-induced apoptotic signals. This interplay between life and death signals precisely regulates neuron number during development. The initial step in NGF survival signaling is the stimulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the NGF receptor, TrkA, which in turn activates key survival and axonal growth regulatory proteins such as PI 3-kinase, Akt, and MEK/MAPK (Kaplan and Miller, 2000; Patapoutian and Reichardt, 2001). The activated survival proteins suppress the activity of apoptotic proteins such as Bad, Forkhead, p53, and BAX (Datta et al., 1999; Mazzoni et al., 1999), and increase the levels and activities of pro-survival proteins such as CREB, Bcl-2, and Np73 (Riccio et al., 1999; Pozniak et al., 2000). NGF-activated TrkA initiates survival signaling by binding to and phosphorylating on tyrosine proteins such as Shc, FRS-2, rAPS, and SH2-B that activate the Ras&#150;PI 3-kinase and Ras&#150;MAPK signaling pathways and PLC-1, which regulates protein kinase C activity and intracellular calcium levels (Kaplan and Miller, 2000; Patapoutian and Reichardt, 2001). The major sites whereby Trk associates with and couples to intracellular signaling pathways in primary neurons are the SHC/FRS-2 and the PLC-1 binding sites, Y490 and Y785, respectively (Atwal et al., 2000). Although TrkA functions by phosphorylating on tyrosine and thereby activating signaling proteins involved in neuronal survival and differentiation, paradoxically, it also activates the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) phosphatase SHP-1 (Vambutas et al., 1995). Because phosphatases such as SHP-1 can have both positive and negative effects on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (Tonks and Neel, 2001), we asked about the function and mechanism of action of this protein in NGF signal transduction.

 MMP is tightly controlled, negatively and positively, by the proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 inhibit MMP, whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues such as Bax, Bak, and BH3-only proteins such as Bid and Bad enhance MMP (3-5). Recent evidence suggests that many stress signals trigger apoptosis, at least in part, by activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (3). BH3-only proteins seem to induce MMP by two different pathways: either by direct activation of Bax/Bak (e.g. Bid or Bim) or by inhibition of anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL (e.g. Bad, Bik) (3, 6).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES &nbsp; The centromere is the site of organization of a kinetochore on mitotic chromosomes that facilitates attachment and alignment of chromosomes on mitotic spindle microtubules (1). Facultative centromere proteins, such as the mitotic motor protein CENP-E and the spindle assembly checkpoint components CENP-F, Zwint, ZW10, MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUBR1 and BUB3, localize to the kinetochore region at specific stages during mitosis and monitor accurate progression from prometaphase to telophase (2&#150;14). Constitutive centromere proteins, such as CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C, CENP-G and CENP-H, on the other hand, remain at the centromere at all stages of the cell cycle (15&#150;19).

 In this study we have identified a novel mammalian RNA binding protein, TRIP, which is localised in the cytoplasm. TRIP binds to double stranded RNAs with high affinity and shows little binding to single stranded RNA or DNA. Double stranded DNA only acts as a competitor at high concentrations, suggesting that TRIP preferentially recognises an A form RNA helix rather than a B form DNA helix. There is no obvious sequence specificity to the TRIP RNA interaction, and this is a property shared with a number of other double stranded RNA binding proteins. This probably reflects the geometry of an A form helix in which the accessible minor groove provides few opportunities for sequence specific recognition (27,28). Whether TRIP binds to a specific subset of RNAs such as HIV-1 TAR in vivo remains to be determined. The RNA binding domain of TRIP does not conform to the well-characterised double stranded RNA binding motif seen in proteins such as TRBP (26), though this motif does have lysine rich elements (29). Instead, the highly basic domain is more reminiscent of those seen in viral proteins such as Tat (30,31), which interact with bulges within regions of double stranded RNA, and cellular proteins such as bicoid whose homeodomain contains a lysine/arginine-rich helix which binds DNA and RNA and regulates translation in Drosophila (32

 Tight junctions consist of transmembrane proteins such as occludin, the claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules coupled to cytoplasmic proteins, including the ZO family (104). Tight junction-associated cytoskeletal proteins such as ZO-1 appear to participate in signal transduction and to provide a link between occludin and the actin cytoskeleton (40). The functional significance of confocal microscopy-observed colocalization of F actin and ZO-1 is supported by the finding that cytochalasin D inhibits cytokine-induced fragmentation of ZO-1 interendothelial staining (13). Alterations in tight junctions may be signaled through the MAPK pathway, as both VEGF and H2O2-induced occludin dissociation from cell junctions and EC barrier dysfunction were partially blocked by MAPK inhibitors (82, 83).

 A sequence alignment of all currently available N.&nbsp;meningitidis TbpB sequences reveals the presence of two different isotypes (12). Both isotypes differ in their molecular masses: isotype I proteins (such as strain B16B6) have molecular masses of ~68 kDa, whereas isotype II proteins (such as strain M982) are characterized by molecular masses of ~80-90 kDa (13). These differences are caused by large sequence inserts predominantly in the C-terminal part of isotype II proteins (4). TbpB sequences from other bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (8) or Moraxella catarrhalis (14) resemble the isotype II proteins found in N.&nbsp;meningitidis, indicating that this isotype is predominant. However, the physiological relevance for two isoforms in the meningococcus is not understood.

These GEM domains are relatively resistant to solubilization with non-ionic detergent such as Triton X-100 and have been given many different names (7). With regard to proteins in the GEM domains, GPI-anchored proteins and signal-transducing proteins, such as GTP-binding proteins, small G proteins, and non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases, have been shown to localize to these membrane domains (6&#150;8). Moreover, some transmembrane proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptors and CD44 are also enriched in the GEM (24,25).

 The genome of HIV-11 is transcribed as a full-length 9-kilobase mRNA that can follow two different "pathways" (1-4). Early in infection, the primary HIV transcript is fully spliced to mRNAs of approximately 2&nbsp;kilobases in length and then transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the mRNAs are translated into a variety of small accessory proteins, such as Tat, Rev, and Nef (3-8). Later in the virus lifecycle, unspliced or partially spliced RNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytosol, where the unspliced RNA is packaged into virus particles; the different partially spliced mRNAs are translated into Gag, Pol, Env, and smaller proteins, such as vif, vpR, and vpU (4, 6-10). This temporal switch in the HIV RNA complexity and the coding potential is mediated by virus coded Rev protein (11-19), an approximately 16-kDa basic RNA-binding protein with two functional domains (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain is involved in RNA binding and oligomerization (20-25), whereas the more C-terminal activation domain (13, 26-30) is thought to interact with the nuclear pore-associated proteins, such as hRIP/Rab (31-35), CRM1 (36-39), and nuclear eIF-5A (40, 41). In the absence of Rev, the RNA transcript is fully spliced; the full-length transcript is never observed in the cytoplasm (3, 8, 9, 13, 16-19).

 Because integrins are able to transduce signals from the extracellular matrix to the intracellular compartment and to initiate proliferation and differentiation through various intracellular signaling pathways (14), their presence in osteoblasts may be important in regulating osteoblast function. Integrins have been shown to be involved in many cellular processes such as development, wound repair, tumor invasion, and inflammation (15, 16). Integrins are composed of an &#223; heterodimer. Various combinations of the and &#223; subunits produce receptors with different ligand specificities. There are 16 known subunits and 8 known &#223; subunits (14, 15). The integrin superfamily has been shown to use primarily an arginine-glycine-asparate (RGD) sequence to recognize and bind ligands (15, 16). Thus, RGD peptides are competitive inhibitors of integrins that bind to these amino acid sequences in bone matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, osteopontin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, and bone sialoprotein (17, 18). Puleo and Bizios (19) showed that the tetrapeptide RGDS inhibits the binding of primary rat osteoblasts to fibronectin (19). The intracellular domains of integrins are thought to interact directly with cytoskeletal proteins such as talin and -actinin (20, 21, 22). In addition, the interaction of integrins with other intracellular proteins such as focal adhesion kinase, which binds the &#223;1 integrin cytoplasmic tail leading to the formation of focal adhesion sites (23, 24), initiates a cell signaling cascade that has been shown to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (14).

 How does PKC-mediated phosphorylation of LIMK2 regulate its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling? Many nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins such as diacylglycerol kinase ,Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and cyclin B1 are phosphorylated near their NLS, thereby affecting their affinity to the importin protein complex (38&#150;40). Ser-283 is far away from the predicted NLS in the primary sequence of LIMK2, indicating that Ser-283 phosphorylation is not directly affecting the binding of NLS of LIMK2 to importin-. LIMK2 phosphorylated at Ser-283 might bind proteins such as 14-3-3, masking the NLS. This protein has been shown to bind to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins after their phosphorylation and to mask their NLS, thereby keeping these proteins in the cytoplasm (41, 42).

 Numerous results suggest that the short cytodomain of APP plays a key role in the regulation of these events. In fact, this cytodomain contains a YENPTY motif that interacts with several PTB-containing adaptor proteins, such as those belonging to the Fe65 protein family (6&#150;8), X11 (9), mDab1 (10), Jip1 (11), Shc (12, 13), and Numb (14). Among these proteins, X11 stabilizes APP, preventing its cleavage by - and -secretases (15, 16), whereas Fe65 overexpression, at least in some cells, increases the generation of A (17). Furthermore, the APP cytodomain interacts with other proteins, such as kinesin-I (18) and PAT1 (19) and is phosphorylated by Abl tyrosine kinase at the Tyr682 residue (20) and by various enzymes at Thr668 (21).

 View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]&nbsp; Fig. 9. &nbsp; Targeting of PYK2 to focal adhesions by ECM proteins and GPCR agonists. Translocation of PYK2 to focal adhesions can be triggered by integrin clustering mediated by binding of ECM proteins such as fibronectin or by GPCR in a PKC-activation dependent manner. Activation of the histamine receptor induces the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG), which leads to activation of PKC and mobilization of calcium from internal stores. Activation of PKC can induce integrin clustering, which is crucial for PYK2 translocation to focal adhesions. The localization of PYK2 at focal adhesion is stabilized by interaction with focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin or p130Cas.

 Treatment of cells with butyrate, TSA, and SAHA induces histone acetylation through inhibition of HDAC activity. The fact that these agents, or the silencing of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 expression, negatively regulate STAT1-dependent transcriptional activation suggests that hyperacetylation of histones negatively regulates STAT1-dependent gene activation. Although HDAC inhibitors play a fundamental role in regulating gene expression through remodeling of chromatin, they are also known to interfere with the deacetylation of several non-histone proteins, such as p53 (80), E2F (81), and MyoD (82). We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that SAHA, TSA, and butyrate inhibit STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity through modification of non-histone proteins, such as coactivators that are involved in the STAT1 transcriptional response or potentially STAT1 itself.

 adhesion. &nbsp; Relocation of cytoskeletal components to the endothelial docking structure The cytoskeletal components involved in the generation of this endothelial structure were analyzed. Samples of 4M7 cells adhered to activated HUVEC and stained for VCAM-1 and F-actin revealed a considerable enrichment of endothelial actin within the docking structure (Fig. 7 A, a&#150;b). Interestingly, this apical actin scaffold appeared not to be connected to basal stress fibers (Fig. 7 A, c&#150;d). On the contrary, tubulin was not present with F-actin at the anchoring structure (Fig. 7 A, e&#150;h). Vinculin and -actinin&#150;GFP also redistributed to this structure with a punctuate pattern (Fig. 7 B, c and d, and C, a&#150;c). Likewise, VASP-GFP colocalized with VCAM-1 (Fig. 7 C, f&#150;g), whereas talin and paxillin-GFP were only found colocalizing with VCAM-1 at some adhesion structures (Fig. 7 B, a and b, and C, d and e). These data indicate that the endothelial docking structure was supported by the actin cytoskeleton, actin bundling proteins such as -actinin, actin-nucleating proteins such as VASP, and focal adhesion proteins such as vinculin, talin or paxillin. The formation of this structure was associated with a remarkable change in distribution of several of these proteins, in particular vinculin, talin, and paxillin, from their normal subcellular localization at focal adhesions at the basal surface to the docking structure at the apical surface.

 Viability of the cell is controlled by many different and distinct signals. The expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, can inhibit apoptosis, while expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax or Bak, can accelerate cell death. It has been shown that Bcl-2 family proteins form homo-and heterodimers (Oltvai et al., 1993 ) and that the relative levels of the anti- and pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family appear to be a key determinant of the fate of cells when confronted with an apoptotic stimulus (Korsmeyer, 1999 ). It is generally accepted that Bcl-2 family proteins exert their effects mainly by controlling mitochondrial permeability transition, but the exact mechanism of their function remains unknown.

 Here we describe calsarcin-3, the third member of the calsarcin family, which is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and is enriched in fast-twitch muscle fibers. Similar to calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2, calsarcin-3 interacts with calcineurin and Z-disc proteins such as -actinin, -filamin, and telethonin. In addition, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel calsarcin-binding proteins in skeletal muscle and found that calsarcins also interact with ZASP (19)/Cypher (20)/Oracle (21). Taken together, our data suggest that calsarcin family proteins may serve a dual role by linking key Z-disc proteins such as -actinin, -filamin, and telethonin and localizing calcineurin signaling to the sarcomere. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES

 Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases,1 EC 2.7.1.137) phosphorylate the D-3 position of the inositol ring in inositol phospholipids and were originally identified through their association with viral oncoproteins and activated tyrosine kinases (1, 2). Receptor-regulated forms of PI 3-kinase appear to prefer to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) in vivo (3-5). The product of this reaction, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), is a candidate second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular responses to growth factors perhaps through the activation of serine/threonine protein kinases such as Akt/PKB and/or certain protein kinase C isoforms and small GTP-binding proteins such as Rac 1&nbsp;(6-10).

 The presence of a wide variety of autoantibodies is a characteristic finding in SLE. Most of the autoantibodies are directed against membranous, intracellular or nuclear target antigens. Some antibodies are directed against fluid phase proteins such as C1q [29] and MBL [27]. Autoantibodies against nuclear proteins, such as antinuclear (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, are used as diagnostic markers in SLE [30], whereas anti-C1q and anti-dsDNA antibodies are also used to monitor lupus activity. A rise in the titre of anti-C1q antibodies is reported to be predictive for renal flares [31]. In patients with SLE, impaired normal mechanisms of waste disposal due to complement deficiency have been hypothesized, and therefore this material can be a source of autoantigens.

 PARP-1 is cleaved by caspase-3 or caspase-7 early during apoptosis in many cell lines and tissues. Several caspase substrates have been shown to play a direct positive or negative role in apoptosis. Among these substrates are pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspases themselves (23, 24) and Bid (25), whose cleavage results in activation and escalation of the apoptotic pathway, as well as anti-apoptotic proteins such as members of the Bcl-2 family (26) and the transcription factor NF-B (27), which, if not cleaved, block the death program. Although the role of PARP-1 cleavage in apoptosis remains to be fully elucidated, substantial insight into this role has been gained during the past several years (3, 16, 17, 28, 29).

 These stellate cell activation-related genes have been identified hitherto using subtractive hybridization (6, 7) and differential display (37). In addition to these conventional methods recent advancements of mass spectrometry have permitted us to analyze proteins in cells and organs on a large scale (9, 10). Previously our proteome analysis of the stellate cell activation identified a total of 43&nbsp;proteins/polypeptides that consistently altered their expression levels when the cells were activated (8). These included the up-regulated proteins such as galectin-1, calcyclin, and calgizzarin, and the down-regulated proteins such as liver carboxylesterase 10&nbsp;and serine protease inhibitor 3&nbsp;(8). Thus, protein level "differential display" using proteomics is evidently a powerful approach for displaying protein expression patterns in activated stellate cells.

 EF-1, the human equivalent of EF-Tu, has been reported to have a chaperone-like function by binding proteins and targeting them for degradation by the ubiquitin system, a role for which EF-Tu can substitute (34). The potential for a chaperone-like role for EF-Tu has been given further credence by recent in vitro work. EF-Tu can aid the renaturation of denatured proteins such as citrate synthase, -glucosidase, and rhodanase (3, 35); forms stable complexes with several unfolded proteins such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and carboxymethyl -lactalbumin; and protects some proteins from irreversible aggregation (3). We speculate that this chaperone activity may have been put to use by infecting bacteriophage in vivo to bind the gol region of gp23.

 An E box has the consensus sequence CANNTG, and is the binding site for homo- or heterodimers of basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Often the heterodimers are between tissue-specific regulatory proteins such as MyoD and ubiquitously expressed proteins such as E47, one product of the E2A gene (50). Both the invariant 8701&nbsp;E box and the 8762&nbsp;E box have the sequence CAGATG. Although the block containing the USF binding site beginning at 8790&nbsp;fulfills the "model row" criterion for conserved (Fig. 1),3 the initial CA of the E box is not found in other mammals examined. Previous studies had not examined the 8701&nbsp;and 8762&nbsp;E boxes, so we tested the function of these sites and analyzed protein binding in vitro.

 assay.EF-hands in intracellular proteins such as calmodulin are arranged pairwise and exhibit cooperative binding of Ca. Alignment of the amino acid sequence between the pairs of EF-hands in rat calmodulin with the 63-kDa protein sequence between EF-hands shows that inter-EF-hand sequence of the 63 kDa has little similarity to calmodulin with a length of 37 amino acids compared to 24 in calmodulin and multiple amino acid substitutions. It is unusual for extracellular proteins to have two well conserved EF-hands. In other calcium binding extracellular matrix proteins, such as the well studied bone protein osteonectin, only one functional EF-hand is present(8, 9) . The second loop of osteonectin does not conform well to the consensus sequence.

 A growing understanding of the molecular, genetic and biochemical changes that occur during the process of carcinogenesis, progression and metastasis has resulted in the focus of drug development shifting from empirical therapy towards therapeutics that act on specific molecular targets responsible for the malignant phenotype [3]. Currently, areas of emphasis in new drug development include: regulators of signal transduction (the HER receptor family, Ras, Raf and MEK kinases) [4&#150;7]; regulators of cell survival (Bcl-2 and its homologs) [8]; oncogenic proteins such as bcr/abl [9]; cell-cycle regulating proteins such as the cyclins, the cyclin-dependent kinases and inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases [10]; and proteins involved in the tumor angiogenesis, such as matrix metalloproteinases [11] and endothelial growth factor receptors [12].

 Based on functional studies and the retention of BH domains, the Bcl-2 family can be divided into three subgroups (1). The Bcl-2 subgroup includes all anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-1 and Mcl-1. The Bax subgroup consists of pro-apoptosis members, such as Bax, Bak and Bad. Both groups contain more than one BH domain. The third subgroup contains BH3-only proteins, such as Bid and Bim, which can interact with either anti-apoptotic proteins or pro-apoptosis members and promote apoptosis (4). The observation that supressors and promoters of cell death interact with each other by forming homodimers or heterodimers suggests that apoptosis is regulated, at least in part, by protein&#150;protein interaction (5,6).

 GPI1-anchored proteins (1, 7&#150;9) and dually acylated proteins (10&#150;12) selectively partition into lipid rafts by virtue of the interaction of their hydrophobic anchors with raft domains. Transmembrane proteins such as flotillin have also been shown to be enriched in lipid rafts compared with the bulk plasma membrane (13). Of special interest has been the finding that many molecules involved in cell signaling are enriched in lipid rafts. This includes proteins such as receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, serpentine receptors, and heterotrimeric and low molecular weight G proteins (for review, see Refs. 14 and 15). As a result of the selective localization of signaling molecules in lipid rafts, these domains are thought to serve as organizational platforms for the process of signal transduction.

 Specificity of the Activated Signaling Pathway-- Next we asked whether the changes in phosphorylation observed were specific for ephrin/Eph interactions or whether other proteins such as growth factors also induce these or similar changes in tyrosine phosphorylation. For this purpose, we analyzed a number of different signaling molecules known to affect the tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of cellular proteins, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and bFGF. We also included fetal calf serum (FCS) in our analysis, which contains a large variety of different growth factors. We observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of p80 after FCS treatment; however, none of these factors led to changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of p120 comparable with those caused by ephA3-AP (Fig. 4).

 Finally, it may be instructive to compare our approach using two-dimensional electrophoresis and the finding of a family of proteins displaying extensive sequence variation to the trend in proteomics toward LC-based methods (72). In the latter approach a complex protein mixture (e.g. total ESP or a molecular weight fraction thereof) is digested and peptides are separated and identified by consecutive (multidimensional) LC and tandem mass spectrometry. Although many proteins can be identified this way, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to identify multiple isoforms of the same proteins, such as Hc15. This study clearly shows that two-dimensional electrophoresis is still the most powerful technique to resolve closely related proteins, such as the many Hc15 and Hc24 isoforms observed in this work.

 Apoptotic phenomena occur in pancreatic &#223;-cells in type 1 diabetes (8), in diabetic retinopathy (9), and in hippocampal neurons in primary diabetic encephalopathy (10,11). Programmed cell death is believed to result from hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (4,12) and depletion of antiapoptotic trophic factors like IGFs, insulin, and C-peptide and downregulation of their receptors (13,14). Apoptogenic stresses are mediated via increased expression of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax, oxidative DNA damage, activation of death receptors, and various upstream caspases inducing activation of caspase-3 as well as noncaspase-dependent apoptotic stressors (11). Proapoptotic activities are counteracted by stress-induced intrinsic antiapoptotic proteins, such as mitochondrial Bcl-xl, the DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (5), and heat shock proteins (HSPs) (15,16).

 In this study, we have successfully combined stringent protein removal with SDS-PAGE separation and sensitive MS analysis to identify a set of proteins cross-linked to DNA in mammalian cells following exposure to IR. We have presented here the identification of 29 proteins that appear to be involved in IR-induced DPCs. These proteins fall into several categories according to their nuclear functions. Among these are structural/nuclear matrix proteins such as actin and vimentin, spliceosome components such as hnRNPs and protein-associated splicing factor, stress-response proteins such as HSP10 and GRP78, chromatin regulatory and structural proteins such as histones, as well as proteins involved in other DNA transactions such as the chromatin remodeling protein CGI-55, and proteins whose nuclear functions are not yet fully known. These proteins must be located within several nanometers of the DNA to become cross-linked. This means that such proteins are in direct association with the DNA or in very close proximity at the time of irradiation or shortly thereafter. Some of the proteins identified here have already been shown to be involved in DNA metabolic processes and in association with DNA, for example the histones, whereas others have not. Another factor affecting the likelihood that a protein will be identified as being involved in DPCs is whether it is sufficiently abundant that it can be visualized as a distinct band on SDS-PAGE and in sufficient yield to be identifiable by MS.

 To test whether this reduction in the receptor levels was due to a generalized effect on protein metabolism, we analyzed the effect of HA on the steady-state levels of other cellular proteins. The profile of [S]methionine-labeled total proteins revealed that there was no overall decrease in protein levels induced by HA treatment (not shown). Western blots for p85-phosphatidylinositol 3`-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C-, SHC, and GAP (Fig. 3C) demonstrated that the cellular abundance of this group of proteins was not affected by the presence of HA in MCF-7 cells. The cellular abundance of other proteins such as - and -catenin, E-cadherin, and of serine/threonine protein kinases such as cdk2, erk-1, and erk-2 was also not affected by HA (not shown).

 In future experiments it will be interesting to test whether the response of the FSH&#223; promoter to GnRH involves LIM-HD proteins such as LHX3. The PGBE element of the GSU gene (that is bound by LIM-HD proteins such as LHX2, LHX3, and LHX4) (31, 33, 35) has been implicated in some aspects of the activation of GSU by GnRH (35, 62, 74). Clearly, transcriptional regulation of FSH&#223; by GnRH and activins is complex. GnRH induction of the FSH&#223; promoter in L&#223;T2 cells is reduced by treatment with follistatin, an activin blocker (21), and activins increase GnRH-mediated FSH release in primates (65). Preliminary experiments indicate that the pFSH&#223; promoter is GnRH responsive in L&#223;T2 cells (West, B. E., and S. J. Rhodes, unpublished observations).

 In humans, as in other eukaryotes, RPA consists of three distinct, evolutionarily well-conserved subunits, RPA70 (70 kDa), RPA32 (32 kDa) and RPA14 (14 kDa) (3). RPA70 interacts with ssDNA as well as with other proteins, such as XPA and Rad51 (4&#150;6). The SSB activity of human RPA70 (hRPA70) resides mainly in the central region of the protein (amino acid residues 175&#150;420, called hRPA70AB), which also interacts with other proteins (2). The N-terminal domain (residues 1&#150;170) participates in specific protein&#150;protein interactions, and the C-terminal domain (residues 450&#150;616) interacts with hRPA32 and hRPA14 (7). hRPA32, which is regulated by cell-cycle-dependent N-terminal phosphorylation, can also bind to ssDNA and interacts with several protein partners, such as XPA and Rad52 (8&#150;11).

 Integrins are the most important family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-matrix interactions (Hynes, 1992). They are heterodimers of noncovalently linked &nbsp;and &nbsp;subunits. So far 15&nbsp;different &nbsp;subunits and 8&nbsp;different &nbsp;subunits are known. The 1 subunit can associate with at least 10&nbsp;different &nbsp;subunits forming the largest subfamily of integrins. Members of the 1 integrin subfamily primarily bind to components of the ECM such as fibronectin, collagens, and laminins, but some of them also participate in direct cell-cell adhesion (Hynes, 1992; Haas and Plow, 1994). The cytoplasmic domain of 1 integrin can directly interact with cytoskeletal proteins such as talin and -actinin and with signal transducing proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK; Schaller et al., 1995) and integrin-linked kinase (Hannigan et al., 1996).

The accumulation of soluble proteins such as Btk-PH, Syk, or p85 at the phagosomal cup (p) was normalized by comparing it to the value of the surrounding cytoplasm (c) using the ratio ([p-c]/c). The enrichment of membrane (m)-bound proteins such as PM&#150;GFP or FcRIIa at the cup was quantified by the ratio (p/m).

 In some PPI-binding proteins short peptides (8&#150;20 residues) have been found to be sufficient for high affinity binding of inositol phosphates or phosphoinositides. Examples include certain actin-associated proteins such as gelsolin (Janmey et al. 1992 ; Yu et al. 1992 ) and profilin (Raghunathan et al. 1992 ; Sohn et al. 1995 ) and some C2 domain&#150;containing proteins such as synaptotagmin (Fukuda et al. 1994 , Fukuda et al. 1995 ). Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which are found in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction and are believed to function in membrane recruitment and regulation of enzymatic activity (Shaw 1996 ; Fukuda and Mikoshiba 1997 ; Lemmon and Ferguson 1998 ), provide a contrasting pattern. In these proteins essentially the entire ~100 amino acid module is necessary for high affinity ligand binding.

 Programmed cell death and apoptosis are active forms of cell suicide which play a variety of important roles under normal physiological conditions and which, when dysregulated, can contribute to several diseases including cancer, autoimmunity, AIDS, and ischemia-associated tissue loss (reviewed in (1) and (2) ). The Bcl-2 family proteins regulate a distal step in an evolutionarily conserved pathway for programmed cell death(1, 3) . Several members of the Bcl-2 protein family can form physical interactions with each other in a complicated network of homo- and heterodimers(4, 5, 6) . Although many details remain unclear at present, in general, the ratio between antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 relative to pro-cell death proteins such as Bax determines the ultimate sensitivity of cells to various apoptotic stimuli(7)

 reaction DESPITE THE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS in neonatal respiratory management, morbidity and mortality due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) resulting from long-term and intensive respiratory support are still a major problem. Barotrauma, volutrauma, oxygen toxicity, and pulmonary infections are crucial factors contributing to the development of BPD. The initial acute pulmonary inflammatory response induces a complex process eventually leading to irreversible lung damage and fibrosis (27). In the network of inflammatory mechanisms, intrapulmonary elevation of neutrophils and macrophages were observed, and several mediators of inflammation have been identified (21, 27). Among others, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, chemoattractant proteins such as IL-8, and fibrogenetic proteins such as transforming growth factor (TGF)- were found to be elevated early in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infants developing BPD (21, 27).

. &nbsp; It has been suggested that GluR1 and GluR2 subunits may have independent trafficking machinery in which the trafficking of GluR1 is regulated by GluR1-interacting proteins such as SAP97 (5, 6). For GluR1/GluR2 heteromeric AMPARs, the ct-GluR1 interactions appear to dominate over GluR2 such that GluR1-containing AMPARs are inserted into the membrane during N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity-dependent plasticity and long term potentiation (5, 35, 36). In contrast, for GluR2/GluR3 heteromeric AMPARs, the ct-GluR2 interactions are believed to dominate and to mediate a continuous activity-independent cycling (11, 13, 22, 35). The effects of GluR2 subunit-interacting proteins, such as PICK1, on GluR1 localization have not been demonstrated. Since GluR1 and GluR2 can form heteromeric AMPARs, we further tested the effects of PICK1 on GluR1 in the presence of GluR2. In heterologous cells, we found that PICK1 formed clusters with homomeric GluR2 and heteromeric GluR1/GluR2 AMPAR complexes (Fig. 4C). Triple transfection of COS-7 cells with GluR1, GluR2, and FLAG-PICK1 resulted in a redistribution of GluR1 that was dependent upon the presence of GluR2 and followed the same pattern of PICK-GluR2 clusters (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that in the absence of GluR1 trafficking machinery (as found in COS-7 cells), GluR2-interacting proteins such as PICK1 could modulate the AMPAR complex as a whole (including GluR1). This mechanism may play an important functional role in neurons, where GluR1-interacting proteins have been down-regulated.

 Prominent cytoplasmic inclusions or aggregates are a hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders (for review, see (20&#150;23)). In ALS patients and SOD1 mutant mice, protein aggregates such as bunina bodies and ubiquitinated/SOD inclusions have been reported (for review, see (24)). It remains controversial whether the presence of inclusions, actually triggers motoneuron death, results from a cell death, process or reflects a cellular protective mechanism (for review, see (1,20&#150;22)). Formation of aggresomes has been postulated to be a protective cellular response to overloading the proteasome in HEK293 cells transfected with mutated forms of SOD1 (25). A hallmark of aggresomes is the deposition of intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin; most aggresomes are delivered to the microtubule-organizing center where they are surrounded by a vimentin &#145;cage&#146; (20,25,26).

The NADPH oxidase system is responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen with the subsequent production of (2). DPI is an inhibitor of flavine-binding proteins such as NADPH oxidase. We (41) have previously reported that treatment of HAECs with DPI suppressed TNF--induced production and VCAM-1 mRNA accumulation. HAECs were pretreated with or without DPI (20 and 40 &#181;M) for 1 h and then treated with TNF- (100 U/ml) for 4 h. Pretreatment with DPI produced a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF--induced MCP-1 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 5). These data suggest that flavin-binding proteins such as NADPH oxidase are involved in the TNF--induced MCP-1 gene expression.

 Rho GTPases function as molecular switches that shuttle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, which can form a complex with GDI (guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) proteins (for a review, see Ref. 39). GTPase activation requires dissociation from GDIs and exchange of GDP for GTP and is catalyzed by guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that are activated by upstream signaling events (45). Once activated, Rho GTPases interact with several effector proteins, such as Rho kinase and p21-activated kinase (PAK), or scaffolding proteins, such as mDia or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), to exert their effect on downstream processes such as the actin cytoskeleton (2, 33). Rho GTPases are turned off by intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, which is enhanced by interaction with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (45).

The cellular functions of Jun vary according to the interacting partners (24). So far, over 50 Jun-associated proteins have been found in various tissues by using biochemical methods, Y2H assay, and other techniques (24). Jun forms a homodimer and heterodimers with Fos/Jun family proteins such as Fos, Fra1, Fra2, FosB, Jun, JunB and JunD (31&#150;34), and with other bZIP family proteins (24). Jun also interacts directly with many proteins, such as transcriptional co-activators, structurally unrelated DNA binding proteins and nuclear structural components (24). Most of the known Jun-associated proteins are transcriptional regulators.

 To develop a vaccine effective against meningococci of serogroup B several non-capsular surface structures are under investigation (6, 10). Importantly, the presence of bactericidal antibodies against N.&nbsp;meningitidis have been strongly correlated with human immunity and protection (20). For that reason, it is believed that non-capsular surface antigens shown to stimulate bactericidal antibodies should be considered as the prime vaccines candidates (6). Early studies using sera of immunized volunteers and convalescent patients indicated that certain meningococcal surface proteins such as the ones responsible for serotype specificity and LPS could induce bactericidal antibodies and be involved in protection (23, 24). mAbs were then used to clearly establish the protective potential of certain meningococcal major surface proteins such as the PorA (class 1), PorB (class 2/3), and Opc (class 5C) (25).

 Our recent data show that OX40 principally functions by suppressing T cell death and does so by maintaining high levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (11) and inhibiting expression or activity of proapoptotic proteins such as Bad and Bim (unpublished data). This conclusion has been reinforced by in vivo studies where agonist antibodies directed to OX40 on a responding naive CD4 cell enhanced primary T cell expansion and survival, and in so doing promoted the development of greater numbers of memory T cells (10, 36). The data here now complement these studies and show that OX40 can act in the response of a memory Th2 cell in an analogous manner and dictate the expansion and persistence of antigen-specific memory effector T cells during recall lung inflammation.

 HMG (high mobility group) proteins 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;are relatively abundant and highly conserved chromatin-associated proteins that are present in all vertebrate cell nuclei (1, 2). The proteins contain two homologous repeats of a 70-80-amino acid sequence, HMG box domains (A and B), and an acidic C-terminal tail. Sequences with similarities to the HMG box domains of HMG-1 were identified in a number of sequence-specific transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins referred to as the HMG-1 box superfamily (1, 3). This superfamily includes both the non-sequence-specific proteins such as mammalian HMG-1, HMG-D from Drosophila, Xenopus transcription factor UBF, and yeast NHP6A, and the sequence-specific proteins such as sex-determining factor SRY and lymphoid enhancer factor LEF-1 (2, 4).

 Elucidation of the components that comprise signaling cascades in cells is a primary theme in molecular endocrinology. These signal transduction pathways are frequently initiated at the plasma membrane by the interaction of a ligand with a cell surface receptor. This interaction can result in activation of a number of pathways that are initiated by stimulation of signaling proteins such as JAK/STAT, small G proteins (such as Ras), or adenylyl cyclase (to generate cAMP). However, when the receptor is coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins such as Gq, phospholipase C is stimulated leading to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the generation of inositol tris-phosphate (IP3) which, in turn, releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 1)(1 ). Alternatively, excitable cells can respond to membrane depolarizing stimuli by altering the gating of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. In either case, as depicted in Fig. 1, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates signaling cascades that lead to essential biological processes such as secretion, cell proliferation, differentiation, and movement. Calcium concentrations are only transiently increased, and various signals can result in changes in either the amplitude and/or frequency of such fluxes. The diffusion of calcium in the cell is severely restricted due to the large number of proteins and organelles that can bind to or otherwise sequester calcium. Thus, global intracellular Ca2+ signals result from the coordination and summation of elementary release events that have been called "Ca2+ puffs" and influence the concentration of free Ca2+ in both cytoplasm and nucleus (2 ).

 For the purposes of this study, the term immunologic synapse is used to describe the area of TCR enrichment. The immunologic synapse was originally described as being composed of two parts: the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) and the peripheral SMAC (p-SMAC) (Monks et al., 1998). The c-SMAC contains proteins such as the TCR complex, CD28, PKC-, and src family kinases. The p-SMAC, consisting of proteins such as CD2, LFA-1, and talin, appears as a ring that surrounds the c-SMAC. Most studies of the immunologic synapse have been done using mouse T cell clones that respond to APC loaded with a specific peptide (Bromley et al., 2001; van der Merwe, 2002). As a reactive peptide for Jurkat T cells is not known, the SAg system was used to mimic peptide-dependent interactions between the TCR and MHC. In the case of Jurkats stimulated with SAg, we were never able to clearly discriminate between c-SMAC and p-SMAC structures as described in mouse clones and preactivated T cells. In general, the site of APC contact in this system showed colocalization of molecules from both the c-SMAC and p-SMAC (unpublished data). This may be a characteristic of Jurkat cells interacting with SAg and APCs, or it may be a feature of T cells stimulated with SAg. It is important to note that proteins such as CD43 and CD45, excluded from the synapse in mouse clones, were also excluded in the Jurkat&#150;SAg system.

 Heparin and the structurally related but less sulfated polysaccharide, HS, are known to bind a number of proteins, such as peptide growth factors, extracellular matrix components, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, and others (for review, see Refs. 8, 9, and 15)). These interactions are generally considered to be electrostatic in nature, involving basic amino acid residues in the protein component and negatively charged groups in the polysaccharide. The interactions with different proteins differ in degree of specificity with regard to carbohydrate structure. Some proteins, such as fibronectin and platelet factor 4&nbsp;(16), were claimed to bind heparin and HS in a nonspecific fashion, i.e. their binding could not be attributed to certain sulfate groups within a sequence of defined size but rather increased with increasing net charge of the saccharide. Other proteins, such as antithrombin (reviewed in Bourin and Lindahl (17)), fibroblast growth factor 2&nbsp;(FGF-2) (18-20), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (21, 22) bind in a more specific fashion. The antithrombin-binding heparin/HS sequence, for example, is a pentasaccharide containing a rare GlcNSO3(3-OSO3) unit, whereas a defined IdceA(2-OSO3) unit is essential for binding of FGF-2. Some proteins may recognize more complex multidomain sequences in HS, as shown in a recent report describing the interferon--binding HS structure that encompasses two terminal highly sulfated domains separated by a N-acetylated domain (23). The current study was undertaken in order to characterize the structural requirements for the interaction between heparin/HS and PDGF-AL.

 In our search for novel genes associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, we have also found differentially expressed genes encoding proteins involved in protein metabolism, such as glutamine synthetase, and genes encoding for structural proteins, such as decorin and laminin. We found that glutamine synthetase, an enzyme that forms glutamate from glutamine, was upregulated in omental fat from type 2 diabetic patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show increased levels of this enzyme in adipose tissue. It has been previously reported that glutamine synthetase activity and mRNA levels were elevated in muscle from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and were reversed by insulin administration (21). We could speculate that high levels of glutamine synthetase may contribute to the substantial alterations of glutamine and alanine metabolism observed in type 2 diabetes.

 Further experimentation will be required to clarify which SNAREs are involved in which platelet exocytosis events. However, from the data presented here and in other reports,16 it appears that syntaxin 2&nbsp;controls dense core release, syntaxin 4&nbsp;contributes to -granule release, and SNAP-23 plays a role in both secretion events (Lemons and Whiteheart, unpublished data). As we get closer to a complete mapping of the secretory machinery of platelets, the next series of questions will focus on how these proteins and their interactions are regulated. In this respect, SNARE binding proteins such as Munc18's19 and pantophysin59,60 and additional regulatory proteins such as the rabs61 and p115/TAP62 will become important subjects for study. The ultimate goal is to determine how extracellular signals impinge on the secretory machinery to mediate granule release.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Hsp40 proteins collaborate specifically with Hsp70 proteins and some other factors to participate in a wide range of cellular processes essential to cell survival, such as assisting the folding, assembly, disassembly, and translocation of newly synthesized proteins, by suppressing aggregation or mediating degradation of misfolded proteins (1, 2). The Hsp40 family proteins are divided into three subtypes (3) (see Scheme 1). They all contain a J domain responsible for binding to the ATPase domain and stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70. Type I Hsp40 proteins, such as Escherichia coli DnaJ, yeast Yjd1, and human Hdj-2, have a Gly/Phe-rich region, which has been suggested to assist J domain interactions with Hsp70 (4). The Gly/Phe-rich region is followed by a conserved cysteine-rich region forming a zinc finger domain and a poorly conserved C-terminal domain. The peptide binding site(s) has been found to locate within these two domains (5&#150;7). Type II Hsp40 proteins, such as yeast Sis1 and mammalian Hdj-1, also contain the J, a Gly/Phe-rich region, and C-terminal domains but without the zinc finger domain (8, 9). Both type I and type II Hsp40 proteins act as molecular chaperones to bind and deliver nonnative proteins to Hsp70 (7, 8, 10), but they are not functionally equivalent (11). Type III Hsp40 proteins, such as yeast YJL162c and virus T antigen, contain only the J domain, and they do not function as molecular chaperones (3).

 Participation of several DNA damage inducible and DNA repair proteins such as ATM, DNA-PK, PARP, Ku, Blm and Wrn both in the telomere integrity sensing and p53 activity modulation provides strong evidence towards a possible way by which telomere signals are transmitted to p53 (23,41). Indeed, stabilization of p53 following transfection of cells with plasmids containing TRs strongly referred to the involvement of post-translational modifications in the activation process. Introduction of extra-chromosomal DNA containing TRs into cells may initiate a DNA damage checkpoint. Activation of p53 by extra-chromosomal TRs could be described by competition with native telomeres for telomere binding proteins such as TRF-1 and TRF-2. It was shown that exposure of native chromosomal ends caused by squelching out of TRF-2 triggers p53 activation through ATM (17).

 To analyze more precisely the cellular mechanisms involved in hepatocyte polyploidization, we followed the division of cells during primary culture. We directly demonstrated that mononuclear 2n hepatocytes were the precursors of binuclear 2 x 2n cells using time-lapse videomicroscopy. We showed that 20% of mononuclear 2n hepatocytes abort cytokinesis; no movement of the contractile ring was observed, and its disappearance led to the genesis of a binuclear cell. This report therefore provides the first direct evidence that acytokinesis forms the basis for hepatocyte binucleation. Previous studies (based on other cell types) had described the binucleation processes as a result of exit from mitosis because of either the absence or abortion of cytokinesis (18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33). However, this process has been observed following antibody suppression or overexpression or the mutagenesis of several proteins involved in cell cleavage. These proteins include passenger proteins such as INCENP (24) and survivin (25); protein kinases such as polo-like kinase and aurora A and B (18, 26, 27); small G-proteins and their regulators such as citron kinase, MgcRacGap, and Vav3 (28, 29, 30); and microtubule motor proteins such as CENP-E (31), MKLP1 (32), and PRC1 (33). Our study offers an experimental model to investigate whether one or several of these proteins are also involved in the physiological hepatocyte binucleation process. In this context, it is interesting to note that a recent study suggested that citron kinase is not implicated in the binucleation process during post-natal liver development (34).

 HSPs are highly conserved intracellular proteins expressed in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, both constitutively and under stress conditions. Several studies have identified HSPs as targets of immune responses during microbial infections (47, 48). Almost two decades ago, Srivastava and colleagues (reviewed in Ref. 49) discovered that some inducible stress proteins, such as HSP70, potently stimulated antigen-specific T cell responses. As HSPs are released from cells as a result of necrotic but not apoptotic death (50), they may be taken up by antigen-presenting cells (51), thereby providing a general pathway through which antigens from cancer cells or infectious agents may be presented to na&iuml;ve T cells in the lymph nodes (52). Stress proteins such as endogenous HSP70 or M. tuberculosis-derived HSP70 are potent adjuvants and link innate and adaptive immune responses (53).

 We further examined whether the association of CD3 is detected in other GPI-anchored proteins. 2B4 cells were solubilized with digitonin lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with various mAbs against other GPI-anchored and transmembrane surface proteins, and immunoblotted with anti-CD3 (Fig. 2). Again, the association of CD3 with TSA-1 was observed and this was confirmed using another rat mAb against TSA-1, GR12. However, none of mAbs against other GPI-anchored proteins such as Thy-1, Ly-6A/E, and Ly-6C, nor mAbs against transmembrane proteins such as LFA-1 and class I co-precipitated CD3. Since these control mAbs were able to immunoprecipitate their corresponding surface Ags efficiently (data not shown), the result demonstrated a selectivity of CD3 chains for the ability to associate with TSA-1 among GPI-anchored molecules.

 For multisubunit proteins such as PSI, an important issue is to understand how a cell continues to produce stoichiometric amounts of various subunits for their assembly into a functional membrane-bound complex (5). The molecular details of the biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus in general, and of the PSI complex in particular, in cyanobacteria have not been widely investigated. In the chloroplasts of vascular plants and green algae, subunits of various thylakoid localized protein complexes are encoded by various plastid genes as well as nuclear genes. The nuclear gene products are imported in the chloroplasts, where they associate with the appropriate plastid gene products, as well as many pigments and cofactors to form functional complexes. Several post-transcriptional processes play crucial roles in the expression, stabilization and assembly of a number of thylakoid proteins (6-8). Mullet et al. (9) have shown that, in greening barley cells, the accumulation of chlorophyll-binding proteins (Chl-proteins) such as the CP43 and D1 proteins of PSII, depends on the availability of chlorophyll molecules. This is physiologically important, since the accumulation of free pigments in the thylakoids may lead to the production of free radicals that are extremely harmful to living cells. An interesting feature of post-transcriptional control is that during the translation of a Chl-protein such as D1, the ribosomes stall at defined positions on the corresponding mRNA so that chlorophyll and other cofactors have the opportunity to be correctly associated with the translated proteins (10). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Rochaix and co-workers (8, 11) have identified various nuclear encoded proteins that regulate the translation of a number of Chl-proteins, such as the D2 and CP43 proteins of PSII. Danon and Mayfield (12) identified two RNA-binding proteins that regulate the expression of the D1 protein in Chlamydomonas. Thus, a variety of post-transcriptional processes control the expression and assembly of the Chl-proteins of PSI and PSII in chloroplasts. In the prokaryotic cyanobacterial cells, effects of light and other environmental agents on the transcription of the psbA and psbD genes, encoding the D1 and D2 proteins, have been examined in detail (13). However, post-transcriptional processes that regulate the expression of genes encoding Chl-proteins in cyanobacterial cells have not been adequately investigated.

 Membrane proteins such as the MPRs and Lamp1 exit the TGN for onward transport to the late endosomes or the plasma membrane either by default or using a signal sequence that interacts specifically with adaptor proteins. The rate of exit of UCE from TGN and therefore the rate of its surface delivery, is reduced in the absence of its TGN exit signal. This leads to the conclusion that UCE requires the TGN exit signal for optimal trafficking out of the TGN. The nature of its signal sequence, however, does not resemble the canonical motifs found in other proteins such as the acidic cluster di-leucine motif found in MPRs or the tyrosine-based motifs present in Lamp-1, leading to the speculation that a novel interacting protein might act in the packaging of UCE at the TGN.

 At least a part of the selectivity achieved in vesicle targeting is attributed to the interaction of cognate vesicle or v-SNAREs and target or t-SNAREs. A cycle between the ER and the Golgi could, in principle, be achieved by two v- and two t-SNAREs, one pair directing anterograde targeting and the other directing retrograde targeting. Given that SNAREs are themselves localized by the secretory pathway, one challenge has been to understand how they may be regulated to express targeting activity in the correct location. The same consideration applies to other proteins that shuttle between the ER and the Golgi. In yeast, Golgi proteins such as Emp47p and ER proteins such as Emp24p continuously cycle yet maintain a concentration in one or the other organelle (Schimm&ouml;ller et al., 1995; Schr&ouml;der et al., 1995).

 HuR Associates Specifically with Importin 1&#151;The above findings prompted a further analysis of components of the nuclear import machinery potentially involved in transporting HuR into the nucleus following AMPK activation. To identify the specific factor(s) that might mediate the import of HuR into the nucleus, we carried out a series of IP reactions coupled with Western blot analyses to investigate potential associations between HuR and other proteins. This survey included a number of transport proteins such as CRM1, NTF2, and members of the karyopherin , importin , and importin families. It also included several negative control proteins, including proteins involved in the structure and function of the nuclear pore complex (such as Ran, Ran-binding protein, and nucleoporins) and nuclear proteins such as HDACs, given the aforementioned evidence that cytoplasmic HuR levels were influenced by altered protein acetylation.

 Paxillin acts as a scaffolding adaptor protein in integrin signaling, by binding to several other integrin-assembly proteins including vinculin, integrin 1, Fak, and c-Src (reviewed in Refs. 37 and 38). Paxillin is tyrosine phosphorylated upon integrin activation (39), and thus creates binding sites for several Src homology 2&nbsp;domain-containing proteins such as Crk-I, Crk-II, Crk-L, and Csk (reviewed in Ref. 38). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin has been shown to be important for cell spreading on the extracellular matrix (40), cell cycle progression (39), as well as adhesion-dependent function of leukocytes (41). Paxillin is composed of multiple isoforms, , , and &nbsp;(42). These isoforms exhibit different biochemical properties in their binding to other proteins such as vinculin and Fak. For example, both the &nbsp;and &nbsp;isoforms bind to Fak whereas the &nbsp;isoform does not (42).

 It is clear from studies on lactotropes (42) and pancreatic acinar cells (49) that precise control of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for normal basal and stimulated secretion. Overexpression of membrane PAM, Kalirin-(447-1124), or full-length Kalirin along with membrane PAM caused enhanced constitutive-like secretion of ACTH (Fig. 10). The fact that Kalirin-(447-1124) exerts this effect indicates that the GDP/GTP exchange factor domain is not essential for the effect of Kalirin on constitutive-like secretion. Kalirin-mediated interactions with endogenous proteins such as HAP1 (60), a cytosolic protein that interacts with p150glued, might play a role. The p150glued protein is an accessory protein for cytoplasmic dynein, which participates in microtubule-dependent retrograde transport of membranous organelles (71, 72). Endogenous proteins such as P-CIP2 may also play a role in this response.

 Recently, several studies have suggested a role for the proteasome in the degradation of ER proteins (25). Whereas proteasomes have never been localized within the lumen of the ER, they have been reported to stud the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (26). Thus, ER retained forms of mutant integral membrane proteins, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (27, 28) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (20, 29), that are most likely degraded by the proteasome on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Proteasomal degradation of mutant ER lumenal proteins, such as prepro -factor (19), 1-1 antitrypsin (21, 23), and carboxypeptidase Y (30, 31), may also occur. Finally, we previously reported proteasomal degradation of PTHrP, a nonmutant secretory protein (16), and others have recently reported proteasomal degradation of apolipoprotein B, another nonmutant protein (32-34).

 Direct modulation of growth factor signalling In a broader context, proteins such as Kek1 and decorin may be thought of as direct modulators of ErbB receptors that could assist in the integration of extracellular events with growth factor signalling. Numerous studies suggest that signalling through integrins, cell adhesion molecules and other cell surface proteins impact ErbB receptor signalling pathways, largely by influencing the extent to which various intracellular signalling pathways respond to receptor activation (Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999; Moghal and Sternberg, 1999). These examples represent indirect modulation of growth factor signalling through crosstalk between downstream components. We propose that LRR-containing proteins such as Kek1 and decorin are members of a larger functionally related class of glycoproteins that directly modulate growth factor signalling pathways by interacting with and influencing the properties of the receptors themselves (Carraway and Sweeney, 2001).

 evolution. Subsequent studies on several DNA-binding proteins, such as the bacterial biotin operon regulator BirA (14) and eukaryotic forkhead and H1/H5 (15), have led to the identification of a modified derivative of the HTH domain known as the winged-helix domain (wHTH) (16). These proteins, in addition to the core three-helix bundle, contain a C-terminal [beta]-hairpin called the wing. In some versions of this domain, the loop between helix 1 (H-1) and helix 2 (H-2) is extended to give rise to [beta]-strand elements that interact with the two strands of the wing. Further sequence-structure analyses have shown that a wide range of eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins, such as HNF3, H1 and HSF, as well as bacterial transcription regulators, such as ompR, BirA and CAP, assume the wHTH structure (13,17,18

 The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, p130CAS, and tensin in G protein-coupled receptor-directed signaling is currently unknown. Although no enzymatic activity has been described, paxillin and tensin do form complexes with other cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin and talin (47, 58). Tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, p130CAS, and tensin may also provide binding sites for the SH2 containing proteins such as Crk family members (30, 34, 60, 61). In turn, Crk can associate with a number of proteins through its SH3 domains, such as two guanine nucleotide exchange proteins, C3G and SOS, and a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Abl (62-64). It will be interesting to see whether CADTK induces paxillin, p130CAS, and tensin tyrosine phosphorylation at sites different than those phosphorylated by p125FAK; if so, CADTK may bring in different SH2 containing proteins and initiate unique signaling pathways.

 localization.A common feature among many cytoskeletal components, especially actin cross-linking proteins, is their ability to form non-covalent dimers via modular domains, including spectrin-like repeats in proteins such as [alpha]-actinin and Ig-like domains in proteins such as ABP-120 (22). The dimerization interface provides rigidity for the molecules and it is also thought to act as a ruler separating structural molecules at a proper distance. Our yeast two-hybrid experiments indicate homotypic interaction for myotilin molecules, which possibly occurs by dimer formation through its Ig domains. The intermolecular interaction between myotilin molecules is in line with the possibility that myotilin would serve as a cytoskeleton-organizing protein. The general ability of Ig domains to serve as an interface for protein interactions suggests that myotilin, through this region, may participate in binding to other sarcomeric/sarcolemmal

 Cyclin/Cdk/CKI stability While Cdks are expressed constitutively and are relatively stable, cyclins are subject to regulated degradation. The degradation of cyclins is regulated by the ubiquitin&#150;proteasome system. Ubiquitination involves the covalent attachment of ubiquitin chains to lysine residues in the target protein, which promotes its recognition and degradation by the proteasome (Harper et al., 2002) (Fig.&#160;4A). Two ubiquitin ligases regulate cell cycle progression: the Skp/Cullin/F-box (SCF) complex targets proteins at the G1/S/G2 phases and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) acts at G2/M (Fig.&#160;4B). Target specificity of these ligases is governed by their binding to adaptor proteins. These comprise F-box sequence motif-containing proteins such as Skp2 in the case of SCF (SCFskp2), or WD-40 repeat-containing proteins such as Cdh1 or Cdc20 in case of APC (APCCdh1, APCCdc20).

 One key in understanding how hnRNPs may facilitate mRNA export is to determine the signals that mediate their shuttling, i.e., their import into and exit from the nucleus. The nucleocytoplasmic transport of A1 has been recently studied in detail, and the signals that mediate shuttling have been identified (Michael et al., 1995b; Siomi and Dreyfuss, 1995; Weighardt et al., 1995). Nuclear import of A1 is determined by a 38-amino acid sequence, termed M9, located near the COOH terminus of the protein between amino acids 268 and 305.&nbsp;Its fusion to cytoplasmic reporter proteins such as pyruvate kinase resulted in rapid import of the fusion protein into the nucleus (Siomi and Dreyfuss, 1995). However, the A1 NLS has no sequence similarity to classical protein NLSs such as that of SV-40 large T antigen or nucleoplasmin (Siomi and Dreyfuss, 1995).

 In contrast, pleckstrin homology (PH)1 domain-containing proteins, such as Crac, PKB, and PhdA, are highly localized at the front of chemotaxing cells (5, 6). The PH domain of Crac binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). Similar to Crac, in mammalian neutrophils and fibroblasts, several PH domain-containing proteins, such as PKB/AKT, are found to preferentially associate with the plasma membrane at the leading edge (4, 7). These findings suggest that these phosphoinositol lipids locally activate the signaling events that lead to actin polymerization at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. Consistent with this idea, the addition of a membrane-permeable form of PI(3,4,5)P3 to fibroblasts and neutrophils triggers the formation of membrane ruffles and increases their motility (8-10).

 The molecular organization of intercellular junctions in the endothelium has been only partially elucidated in the last few years. At least three types of complex structures have been described: tight junctions, adherens junctions, and complexus adhaerentes. All of these structures are formed by specific transmembrane proteins, which through their extracellular region promote homotypic cell-to-cell adhesion and through the cytoplasmic tail bind to a complex network of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins (1-3). Outside of these junctional structures, other adhesive proteins such as PECAM1 (4) or S-Endo-1/Muc-18 (5) have been found to be clustered at intercellular contacts. The intracellular molecules that associate with adherens junctions are different from those that associate with tight junctions and from those that link other junctional adhesion proteins such as PECAM, suggesting that a certain specificity in signaling should exist (3).

 In humans, it is well documented that the development of muscle soreness is associated with reduced force production (6, 8, 9, 16) and limitation in the range of movement (6-8). In both animal and human studies, structural damage, including myofilament disruption (11, 15) and muscle swelling (12), have been observed. Muscle cells undergo some loss of the cytoskeletal proteins, such as titin and desmin, and fibronectin from the plasma is deposited inside the fibers, indicating a loss of cellular integrity (6, 19, 20). Inflammation occurs, resulting in phagocyte infiltration to the injured muscle, and protein degradation becomes elevated ~48 h after the injury (23). Intracellular proteins, such as creatine kinase and glutamic oxaloacetic acid transaminase, are released into the blood (12). It has been shown that the damage may last for as long as 14&nbsp;days before full recovery (23).

 Caspases play a critical role in the execution of apoptosis in a number of cell types (8). Most of the caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are processed to active (cleaved) forms in cells undergoing apoptosis. Caspase cleavage occurs by self-proteolysis and/or results from the actions other proteins (8). The cleaved forms consist of large (17&#150;20 kDa) and small (10&#150;12 kDa) subunits. Caspases can be classified as initiators (caspase-8, -9, and -10) or effectors (caspase-3, -6, and -7) (9). Under the appropriate stimulus, caspase-8 and/or -10 and caspase-9, which are themselves activated by Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and Apaf, respectively, activate effector caspases that, in turn, degrade or activate their cellular substrates [e.g. cytoplasmic structural proteins such as actin or nuclear proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] (9).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Cytoskeletal polymers as carrier structures Top Abstract Introduction Fast and slow axonal... Movement of membranous... Movement of cytoskeletal... Cytoskeletal polymers as carrier... Beyond fast and slow:... References &nbsp; Cytoskeletal proteins have been the exclusive focus of studies on slow axonal transport in recent years, but it is important to remember that several hundred other proteins also move in this rate group, representing the entire spectrum of cytosolic proteins that comprise axoplasm. Some examples include proteins involved in vesicle dynamics such as clathrin and synapsin; regulatory proteins such as calmodulin; metabolic enzymes such as creatine kinase, aldolase, and enolase; cytoskeletal proteins such as spectrin, tau, and dynactin; and motor proteins such as dynein and myosin (Lasek et al., 1984; Paggi and Petrucci, 1992; Dillman et al., 1996; Rao et al., 2002). The sheer number and diversity of these proteins and the fact that they move together for days, weeks, or months as they travel down the axon, suggest that they associate with a common class of nonmembranous carrier structures analogous to the membranous organelles of fast axonal transport, but the identity of these carrier structures is not known. One hypothesis, first proposed more than 15 years ago, is that cytoskeletal polymers fulfill this role and that other cytosolic proteins are transported by riding piggyback on the moving polymers (Lasek et al., 1984, Lasek, 1986). According to this hypothesis, the transport rate of cytosolic proteins is determined by the proportion of the time that they spend in association with the cytoskeletal polymers, as well as by the rate and frequency of movement of the polymers themselves.

 The nucleotide sequence of the genomic DNA upstream of the hKCC1 cDNA transcription start site is shown in Figure 3. Inspection of the sequence reveals a lack of consensus TATA or CCAAT sequences. Consensus sequences for a number of potential DNA-binding proteins, including GATA-1 (2 imperfect sites), GC/CACC-binding related proteins (3 sites), and AP-2 (3 sites) are present in the 5'-flanking sequences. GATA motifs bind GATA-1, a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid development.44,45 GC or GT/CACC motifs are the binding sites for a number of transcription factors, including ubiquitous proteins such as Sp1 and cell-restricted proteins such as members of the KLF family.45,46 AP-2 proteins bind GC-rich sequences and are important in a wide variety of processes, including development, apoptosis, and cell cycle control.47

 Virus inhibition of apoptosis can be achieved through inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspases and p53 or expression of viral counterparts to anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 (Roulston et al., 1999). However, numerous other signalling pathways exist within the eukaryotic cell, which regulate the balance between apoptosis and cell survival. The enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is central to many cell signal transduction pathways and acts on several downstream effectors to regulate a diverse range of cellular events (Cantrell, 2001). The serine&#150;threonine kinase, Akt, is one such effector, and the PI3K&#150;Akt pathway has proven to be vitally important in cell survival (Chan et al., 1999). Constitutive up-regulation of PI3K&#150;Akt cell survival signalling has also been implicated in oncogenic transformation and tumour development, as it prevents apoptotic cell death during uncontrolled proliferation (Chang et al., 2003).

 EBP-50 is decreased in the pulmonary epithelium in the absence of Foxj1 Ezrin binds to apical proteins either directly or indirectly through other scaffold proteins such as ezrin binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP-50) or E3KARP (Bretscher et al., 2002). EBP-50 is a two PDZ-domain containing protein that links ezrin with apical proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, the &#223;2-adrenergic receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and NHE-3 (Bretscher et al., 2002). By sequential, double immunofluorescence with primary antibody to EBP-50 and acetylated -tubulin, EBP-50 was found to be localized to the apical region of ciliated cells in foxj1+/+ airway epithelium in a fashion similar to ezrin (Fig. 4A). There was a marked decrease in EBP-50 observed in the airways of foxj1-/- mice compared to wild-type pulmonary epithelium (Fig. 4A,B).

 Although tBid does not insert in DOPC/DOPG lipid bilayers, we cannot exclude the possibility that trans-membrane insertion may be driven by the presence of natural mitochondrial lipids, such as cardiolipin and monolysocardiolipin. These lipids both bind tBid (14) and are concentrated at mitochondrial outer-inner membrane contact sites where tBid localizes; however, a recent EPR study using these lipids also found no evidence of tBid helix insertion through the membrane (44). It is also possible that trans-membrane insertion of tBid requires post-translational N-terminal myristoylation, since this has been shown to enhance Bid-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis (48), and that the interactions with other Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bak and Bax or with other nonhomologous proteins such as the mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channel may promote insertion of the tBid helices through the mitochondrial membrane.

 Programmed cell death generally requires the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential to release apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. These factors activate protein caspases that degrade cellular proteins leading to apoptosis. Up-regulation of the BCL-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL can prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. In addition, BCL-2 expression can inhibit apoptosis in a cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 "apoptosome"-independent manner.58 Conversely, induction of BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAD can inactivate BCL-2 family antiapoptotic proteins leading to apoptosis (for a review, see Huang59). Cell death-suppressing signal transduction pathways such as the AKT and STAT5 pathways up-regulate BCL-2 antiapoptotic family members such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL to inhibit apoptosis.60-62

 As shown in Fig. 5A, immunostaining for PC1-RGD-Myc was observed both paranuclearly and at the cellular tips (dark triangles). This pattern is very similar to that previously observed in AtT20 cells in our laboratory with the endocrine hormone ACTH, which is localized both at the TGN (paranuclear) and in secretory granules (cellular extension tips) (34). In contrast, in the case of PC1-RGE-Myc most of the Myc immunoreaction was found paranuclearly (Fig. 5B) and the staining at the cellular extension tips was very weak (Fig. 5B, arrows). This pattern resembles that of constitutively secreted proteins such as 1-PDX in AtT20 cells and of resident Golgi proteins, such as TGN38 (34). These data agree with those in Fig. 4, whereby PC1-RGD-Myc can enter the regulated secretory pathway, whereas PC1-RGE-Myc exits the cell predominantly via the constitutive pathway.

 IN SMOOTH MUSCLES, Ca2+ signals regulate contractile activity by the classic Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (Cal) via regulation of Cal-binding proteins such as caldesmon and calponin (13, 40, 45). Cal-dependent protein kinase can also regulate ion channel activities (3, 14, 17, 21, 22). Recently, physiological and biochemical analyses have demonstrated novel properties and functions of Cal-superfamily proteins such as neuronal Ca2+-binding proteins (NCBPs) (7) and Cal-like Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) (12). In neuronal cells, NCBPs regulate multiple target proteins and CaBPs functions as Cal-like proteins in some of Cal-regulatory processes. Szymanski et al. (42) showed that differences in Cal densities are involved in phasic and tonic behavior of smooth muscles (42). Therefore, identification of NCBP and CaBP components in gastrointestinal smooth muscles (GISMs) would provide important additional information concerning the regulation of contractile behavior and electrical rhythmicity.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES &nbsp; Although there is considerable understanding of how organelles move through the cytoplasm and axoplasm (1), very little is known about how nonvesicle-associated proteins, such as steroid receptors and other signaling proteins, move through the cytoplasm to arrive at their sites of action in the nucleus. It could be that these protein solutes move through the cytoplasm by diffusion and then become trapped at their sites of action by protein-protein interactions, such as by the binding of a localization signal by a signal recognition protein. Alternatively, protein solutes may utilize a movement machinery to traverse the cytoplasm, in which case, movement would likely occur along cytoskeletal tracts. Evidence exists in support of both movement by diffusion and a movement machinery, and it may be that protein solutes move through the cytoplasm by both mechanisms.

 Bcl-2 family proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved group of cell death regulators, with homologues found in vertebrates and invertebrates. Members of this family include both cell death&#150;inducing and cell death&#150;blocking proteins (17). Though intensively investigated, it remains unclear how Bcl-2 family proteins control cell life and death. Many Bcl-2 family proteins contain a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain at their COOH terminus that targets them to the membranes of mitochondria and some other organelles (18) (19). Overexpression of mammalian antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL has been shown to protect mitochondria from various cell death stimuli, preserving transmembrane potential () and preventing release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins (20) (21). Conversely, overexpression of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax or Bak can result in release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and mitochondrial membrane depolarization (22) (23) (24) (25).

 INTERACTIONS between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton are involved in controlling cell shape, in organizing membrane proteins into domains, and in regulating membrane domain function (52). Some of these domains contain membrane-spanning proteins, such as ion channels and adhesion molecules, which are localized because of interactions with cortical meshworks of spectrin-cross-linked actin filaments (7, 27). Other actin-based membrane skeletons underlie membrane domains responsible for cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion (64, 80). For instance, intercellular adhesion at adherens junctions, which is mediated by Ca2+-sensitive transmembrane proteins called cadherins, depends upon cadherin attachment to actin filaments through linker proteins, such as - and -catenins (1). Similarly, indirect interactions between actin filaments and integrins, mediated through numerous other linker proteins in focal contacts, can regulate integrin binding to ligands in the extracellular matrix and thus affect cell-substrate adhesion (13, 87).

 Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase that mediates signaling initiated by death stimuli such as TNF-, Fas activation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage (10, 11). Consistent with its role in apoptotic signaling, dominant negative mutants of ASK1 are resistant to TNF- and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (12). ASK1 function is modulated by a host of protein-protein interactions and is crucial to both survival and apoptotic processes. ASK1 binds many proapoptotic proteins such as TRAF-2, DAXX, and ALG-2, to facilitate TNF-- and Fas-mediated cell death (13). Conversely, proteins such as Hsp72, thioredoxin, and 14-3-3 are negative regulators of ASK1 which promote cell survival (11, 14, 15). Recently, Chen et al. (16) reported an interaction between ASK1 and the kinase Raf-1; this inhibited the apoptotic activity of ASK1, independent of the MEK-ERK pathway.

 Microtubule stability is promoted to a large degree by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Classical MAPs, such as MAP2 and Tau, bind to the surface of the microtubule, bridging several tubulin subunits and possibly neutralizing the repulsive negative charge on the microtubule surface. Other MAPs, such as the highly conserved XMAP215/Stu2p/TOG family, may be enriched on a subset of microtubules. Microtubule-end-binding MAPs, such as CLIP-170 and EB1, may copolymerize with new tubulin subunits, selectively bind to a special conformation of the microtubule end, and/or serve as attachments for growing or shortening microtubules to kinetochores or cellular membranes through interaction with proteins such as the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein and CLASPs (CLIP-associated proteins). Binding of the dynein-dynactin motor complex, along with proteins such as LIS1, to microtubule ends and cortical sites or the kinetochore also appears to stabilize microtubules.

 We found that DIF-3 not only elevated the activity of GSK-3 but also induced nuclear translocation of the kinase. GSK-3 was initially considered to be a soluble protein expressed in cytoplasm; however, GSK-3 would have no access to nuclear proteins such as cyclin D1 if it resided in cytoplasm. Recent evidence has indicated that GSK-3 in nucleus phosphorylates nuclear proteins, such as cyclin D1 (12), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (17), heat shock factor-1 (18), and cAMP-response element-binding protein (19). Indeed, GSK-3 has been identified from the nuclei of cell cycle-arrested NIH-3T3 cells (12), cardiomyocytes stimulated with endothelin-1 (20), and heat shock- and staurosporine-treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (21). Therefore, DIF-3 seems to make it possible for GSK-3 to phosphorylate cyclin D1 by translocating GSK-3 into the nucleus.

 In the yeast two-hybrid assay, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and A1 all bound to Bax and Bak, whereas Bcl-xS, Bad, and Ced-9 did not (Table I). Therefore, anti-death activity was associated with the ability to bind to Bax or Bak. Proteins such as Ced-9, Bcl-xS, and Bad that did not bind to Bax/Bak did not inhibit killing, whereas proteins that could associate, such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, were inhibitory. Since the lack of death suppressor activity of Ced-9 was unexpected, its association with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family was determined. LexA-Ced-9 (as well as LexA-Bcl-xS and LexA-Bad) bound to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and A1 (data not shown). Therefore, Ced-9 had the binding and activity profiles of proteins such as Bcl-xS rather than Bcl-2.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion Top Abstract Material and Methods Results Discussion References &nbsp; Many patients with ESRD develop soft-tissue calcification, but the pathogenesis of this process is not clearly understood. Although the elevated serum phosphorus level, increased calcium x phosphorus product, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, older age, and prolonged time on hemodialysis are known factors that are associated with uremic calcification, our study revealed no associations between penile or epididymal calcification and any one of these parameters (Drueke, 1996). This raises the question of whether other factors are responsible for the pathogenesis. Recent evidence indicates that uremic calcification is a cell-mediated process, which means that elevated levels of transforming growth factor; vitamin K&#150;dependent proteins, such as osteocalcin and atherocalcin; and deficiencies in calcium-regulatory proteins, such as fetuin, may also be contributing factors (Jacoby and Semenkovich, 2001; Tintut and Demer, 2001; Ketteler et al, 2002; Jian et al, 2003).

 RetGC-1 has been shown to be regulated by proteins, such as GCAPs (14, 21-23) and RGS9 (41), in photoreceptor outer segments. It is possible that the 210-kDa cross-linked product of retGC-1 in the ROS homogenate (Fig. 1) is a complex of retGC-1 with these retGC regulators. As shown in Fig. 2, the ROS homogenate contained GCAPs; however, GCAPs were not detected in the 210-kDa cross-linked product although under these conditions the formation of the 210-kDa cross-linked product was stimulated by GCAPs, as described below. In addition, the ROS homogenate also contained RGS9; however, RGS9 was not present in the 210-kDa product. These observations support our conclusion that the 210-kDa cross-linked product is a homodimer of retGC-1, but not a monomeric form of retGC-1 cross-linked with other proteins, such as GCAPs and RGS9.

 Accumulating evidence indicates that Ras (Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras) serve as downstream molecules for tyrosine kinase-type receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor, as well as Src family members (for reviews, see (1) and (2) ). Ras appears to transmit its signal to influence expression of genes that control cell cycle, proliferation, and differentiation(1, 2) . Ras has a GDP-bound inactive form and GTP-bound active form, the latter of which recognizes target proteins including c-Raf-1. The GDP-bound form is converted to the GTP-bound form by GDP/GTP exchange reaction, which is regulated by GDP/GTP exchange proteins such as Smg GDS, mSos, and mCdc25(3, 4, 5, 6) . The GTP-bound form is converted to the GDP-bound form by intrinsic GTPase activity, which is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins such as p120 GAP, ()NF1, and Gap1(7, 8, 9)

 Strand transfer proteins such as Rad51 have been characterized using an in vitro strand transfer reaction that mimics the early steps in double-strand break repair (1,2). In this reaction (see Fig. 1A), a nucleoprotein filament consisting of a single-stranded circular (ssC) DNA coated with Rad51 reacts with a homologous double-stranded linear (dsL) DNA. A single-stranded DNA-binding protein, such as yeast RPA, is required for efficient strand transfer (3&#150;5). During transfer, the complementary strand of the dsL substrate anneals to the ssC substrate to form a strand transfer intermediate with three DNA strands (2,6; Scandellari et al., submitted for publication). If the substrates are homologous, ATP-dependent unidirectional branch migration continues until nicked circular (NC) and single-stranded linear (ssL) products are released (3,7). The two substrates, intermediate joint molecules, and two product DNAs are easily separated by agarose gel electrophoresis.

 myeloperoxidase. &nbsp; The initial analysis of granule subset proteomes was carried out by subjecting whole granules to 2DE. Fig. 2A shows the separation of gelatinase granule proteins. A total of 38 proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis of MALDI MS spectral data. Thirty of these proteins were cytoskeletal and luminal proteins. The 2D gels of specific granule proteins were dominated by large amounts of luminal proteins, such as lactoferrin and lipocalin (NGAL), which were present in such high abundance that proteins focused poorly (Fig. 2B). A total of 26 proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. The only cytoskeletal protein identified was actin (Fig. 2B). Separation of azurophil granule proteins by 2DE revealed large amounts of highly basic proteins, such as myeloperoxidase, that focused poorly, leading to extensive smearing on the basic end of the gel (Fig. 2C). Only eight proteins were identified from the azurophil granule gel.

 In addition to nuclear protein import, importin-&#223; was shown to have a role in the organization of microtubules by regulating spatial and temporal distribution of microtubule-associated proteins throughout the cell cycle (Wiese et al., 2001; Nachury et al., 2001; Gruss et al., 2001). Briefly, during interphase, proteins such as NuMA and TPX2 that are required for mitotic spindle assembly are retained inside the nucleus. During mitosis, following the disassembly of the nuclear envelope (NE), the aforementioned proteins diffuse into the cytoplasm where importin-&#223; binds and thus keeps them away from the chromatin. RanGTP was shown to be responsible for releasing proteins such as NuMA and TPX2, in the vicinity of the chromatin, from importin-&#223; or the importin-/&#223; heterodimer. Ran is also involved in NE assembly by attracting and/or binding membrane vesicles (Zhang and Clarke, 2000) and is required for vesicle fusion around chromatin (Hetzer et al., 2000).

 Tau fibrillization is accompanied by extensive phosphorylation on over 25 distinct sites (2, 3), some of which function to modulate the ability of tau to bind and stabilize microtubules (4, 5). Candidate enzymes for catalyzing the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in disease include members of the CK1 family of protein kinases, which in mammals consist of at least seven isoforms derived from distinct genes including Cki, , 1, 2, 3, , and (6&#150;10). Each isoform shares a highly conserved N-terminal catalytic domain (11) with diverse C-terminal domains of variable lengths. CK1 family members phosphorylate cytoskeletal proteins such as spectrin, troponin, myosin, ankyrin, tau, and -synuclein (12&#150;17), but also non-cytoskeletal proteins such as SV40 T antigen (18), p53 (14, 19), and -catenin (20). Phosphorylation of these substrates is thought to modulate diverse physiological functions such as vesicular trafficking, DNA repair, cell cycle kinetics, and cell division (21).

 However, analyses of the regulation of gene activity have mostly focused on the role of promoters and enhancers on transcription. In a frequently used experimental paradigm, the efficiency of a promoter is analyzed in constructs where more or less extended fragments of the 5' region preceding the transcription site control the expression of a reporter protein, such as -galactosidase, luciferase, or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT).1 This protocol is convenient and allows a systematic exploration of the upstream promoter region, but it neglects the regulatory elements that may be located downstream of the transcription initiation site, especially within the transcribed region, although the existence of such downstream regulatory elements has indeed been reported, particularly in introns. Thus, the possible influence of the coding sequence on transcription is generally ignored. In addition, the properties of the protein itself, such as its folding efficiency, may limit the production of a functional molecule.

 Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels. Many solid tumors are critically dependent on this new blood vessel formation to provide nutrients and oxygen and to support growth; thus, antiangiogenic therapy is an important goal for cancer therapy. Angiogenesis consists of the following steps: (1) endothelial cell detachment from adhesive proteins; (2) enzymatic degradation of the basement membrane by plasmin or plasmin-activated matrix metalloproteinases; (3) endothelial cell migration into perivascular spaces; (4) proliferation; and (5) tube formation. These steps result in new vessels. Stimuli include basic fibroblast growth factor FGF2, vascular endothelial cell growth factors (VEGF), other growth factors, and cytokines. Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis include plasma proteins such as thrombospondin and fragments of plasma proteins such as angiostatin, which is a proteolytic degradation product of plasminogen. Inhibition of angiogenesis can be mediated at 1&nbsp;or more of the critical steps in the process.

 strands &nbsp; One diagnostic feature that can be used to discriminate between the various classes of cupin is whether the conserved domain occurs singly, in proteins such as transcription regulators and PMIs (Dunwell 1998a ), or in a duplicated form within proteins such as the OXDCs (Dunwell and Gane 1998 ) and seed storage proteins (B&auml;umlein et al. 1995 ); these two-domain proteins have been termed bi-cupins (Dunwell 1998a ). The evolutionary origin of cupins, and, indeed, that of bi-cupins, has yet to be resolved; these latter could have been the result of one or more gene duplication events leading to separate evolution of the different classes (Shutov, Blattner, and Baumlein 1999 ). This paper presents evidence on the evolutionary relationships within the cupin superfamily, with a focus on single-domain plant GLPs, the conservation of structure, and the significance of the active-site ligands in the possible function of these proteins.

 Ectromelia virus (ECTV; family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus) is a natural pathogen of laboratory mice that causes a generalized mousepox, with a high mortality rate and conjunctivitis occurring during natural infection (Fenner &amp; Buller, 1997). Poxviruses, including ECTV, have been shown to encode many gene products that are able to suppress apoptosis, such as inhibitors of cytokine processing and proteolytic activation of caspases, soluble receptors that neutralize various cytokines, factors that inactivate interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral enzyme activities and analogues of growth factors and hormones (Buller &amp; Palumbo, 1991). During infection with ECTV several anti-apoptotic proteins, such as tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) type II homologue (cytokine response modifier &#150; crmD) and serpins SPI-1, SPI-2 and SPI-3, are produced as well as immunomodulatory proteins such as IFN--binding protein (Buller &amp; Palumbo, 1991; Brick et al., 2000; Smith &amp; Alcami, 2000; Smith et al., 2000; Turner et al., 2000; Saraiva &amp; Alcami, 2001).

 MANY cellular processes rely in large part on the correct subcellular distribution of effector proteins. At specialized sites of cell-cell contact, membrane proteins are clustered with specific adaptor proteins linked to the cytoskeleton, enabling cellular adhesion, motility, and intercellular as well as intracellular signaling events to occur (Kofron et al., 1997; Tsukita et al., 1996, 1997). Some proteins, which are localized to specific cell junctions and presumably influence their function, have been identified. In epithelial cells, the specialized site of cell contact known as the tight junction (zonula occludens) has been shown to be composed of transmembrane proteins such as occludin (Furuse et al., 1993) and juxtamembrane proteins such as ZO-1 (Stevenson et al., 1986), ZO-2 (Jesaitis and Goodenough, 1994), ZO-3 (Haskins et al., 1998), cingulin (Citi et al., 1988), 7H6 (Zhong et al., 1993), and AF-6 (Mandai et al., 1997; Yamamoto et al., 1997).

 The focal complexes and focal adhesions formed in response to p21 GTPase activity are sites of integrin engagement with the extracellular matrix that consist of structural proteins, such as talin and vinculin, that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and regulatory proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, that likely transduce integrin-, as well as growth factor-dependent signals (Clark and Brugge, 1995; Craig and Johnson, 1996). Paxillin likely serves a multidomain adaptor function at these sites (Turner et al., 1990; Tachibana et al., 1995; Turner, 1998). Indeed, the paxillin NH2 terminus contains binding sites for the nonreceptor kinases FAK, PYK2, Csk, Src, and the structural protein vinculin (Sabe et al., 1994; Turner and Miller, 1994; Schaller and Parsons, 1995; Tachibana et al., 1995; Salgia et al., 1995), whereas the COOH terminus, composed of four LIM domains, mediates paxillin targeting to focal adhesions (Brown et al., 1996, 1998a).

 The association of integrins with the cell cytoskeleton and the formation of cell adhesions have been the most widely studied in the aspects of cytoplasmic domain functions. The cytoplasmic domains of the integrin 1, in particular, have been demonstrated to play central roles in many aspects of integrin function such as cell adhesion, cell migration, control of cell differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death. In recent studies (10, 11), more cellular proteins have been reported to directly or indirectly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin 1. Cytoskeletal proteins such as -actinin, F-actin, skelemin, talin, vinculin, filamin, and tensin are known to bind the integrin 1 cytoplasmic domain (12-15). Also, signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase, integrin-linked kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Src, Cas, and novel proteins such as TAP 20 are targeted to adhesion sites where they come into contact with the integrin cytoplasmic domain (16-24).

 Many LysR proteins bind unusually long regions of DNA upstream of their target genes. Such long binding sites suggest that LysR proteins are functionally multimeric, and several members have been reported to be either dimers or tetramers in solution, yet few data are available about their oligomeric state when DNA bound (see below). Based on mutational studies of several LysR proteins, oligomerization appears to be mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (11-13). Although binding to DNA is independent of the presence of an inducer, inducing ligands often cause a conformational change in these complexes. For some proteins, such as CatR (14), TrpI (15), and NahR (16), the inducing ligand appears to increase the number of bound protein monomers, whereas in other LysR proteins, such as OccR (7) and OxyR (9), the inducer does not alter the number of bound monomers but alters the sites of DNA contact.

 Interestingly, degradation of TNF mRNA in the absence of MK2 is increased only marginally. This is in agreement with the finding that the p38 MAPK/ARE axis mainly regulates translation of TNF mRNA and not its absolute level or stability (6, 15) and that TNF mRNA stability and hypoadenylation are not significantly altered in LPS-stimulated macrophages (23). Other studies also indicate that, depending on the cellular context, TNF mRNA is also regulated on the stability level, and ARE-binding proteins such as tristetraprolin (TTP) (25) or HuR (26), which decrease or increase its half-life, have been described. However, ARE-binding proteins such as TIAR (27) and TIA-1 (28) confer specific translational regulation of the TNF mRNA. Deletion of TIA-1 from mouse macrophages does not alter transcript stability but increases the level of TNF mRNA that is associated with the polysomes (28), strongly indicating translational control of TNF.

 Lysosomal proteins use multiple targeting pathways: 1) delivery of soluble hydrolases from the Golgi apparatus to late endosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (29); 2) delivery of lysosomal membrane proteins such as lysosomal acid phosphatase, lysosomal integral membrane protein I, and lysosomal endosomal protein 100&nbsp;by transport through the endocytic pathway to endosomes and lysosomes (30-32); and 3) delivery of membrane proteins such as lysosomal associated membrane protein (32) and lysosomal integral membrane protein II (33) from the trans-Golgi apparatus to endosomes and lysosomes. A minor pathway may route lysosomal associated membrane proteins to the lysosomes via the plasma membrane (34). Lysosomal targeting of lysosomal associated membrane protein and lysosomal integral membrane protein I depends on a critical tyrosine-based motif, and lysosomal integral membrane protein II targeting depends on a dileucine-based sorting determinant present in 10-20 amino acids of their long cytoplasmic domains (35-39).

 In the case of EGFR, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain provides docking sites for SH2 domain proteins, including the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex Grb2&#183;mSos, Ras-GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase C, the p85&#183;p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases c-Src and c-Fyn, as well as for adapter proteins such as Shc and Gab1. Thus the phosphorylated EGFR serves as a scaffold for the assembly, at the plasma membrane, of a multienzyme-signaling complex that mediates the intracellular response to EGF (1). Unlike the EGF receptor, autophosphorylated insulin family receptors do not signal via the direct recruitment of these signaling proteins. Instead, insulin and IGF-1 induce phosphorylation of separate adapter proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and Shc. These adapter proteins, in turn, function as intermediates between the receptor and SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins (2).

 signaling.Recent investigations have shown that receptor tyrosine kinases link to downstream signaling components, like ERKs, via adaptor proteins that have no apparent enzymatic function but trigger off signaling cascades by assembling proteins into reactive complexes. Protein-protein interactions occur via binding of modular domains on the adaptor protein, such as Src homology 2 (SH2), Src homology 3 (SH3), pleckstrin homology, and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, to specific sequence motifs on the target proteins(17, 18) . One such adaptor protein, GRB-2, essentially consists of two SH3 domains flanking a solitary SH2 domain. GRB-2 has been shown to bind to autophosphorylated receptors such as those of EGF, PDGF, CSF-1, and insulin, as well as to tyrosine-phosphorylated, non-receptor proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Recently, GRB-2-GST fusion proteins were also used to identify novel tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bind to GRB-2(19, 20, 21, 22)

 Organ-specific accumulation of the PSII-S protein was investigated in 2-week-old green spinach plants. The plants were divided into cotyledons, upper hypocotyl, lower hypocotyl, and roots and the plastid membranes were isolated from each section and finally the PSII-S protein was detected by immunoblotting (Fig.&nbsp;6). The PSII-S protein is present only in photosynthetic tissues, mainly in cotyledons, but the protein (25-30%) is also detectable in the upper hypocotyl. Other chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, such as LHCII and CP24, exhibit a similar distribution although only traces of these proteins are present in the upper hypocotyl (Fig.&nbsp;6). The same result is found for the chlorophyll a-binding proteins D1 and D2, whereas non-chlorophyll-binding proteins such as the extrinsic PSII-O, PSII-P, PSII-Q, or cytochrome b are present also in non-photosynthetic tissue such as the lower hypocotyl and the roots (not

 cells.The ZO-1 tight junction-associated protein, whose cellular localization is regulated in an antagonistic manner by glucocorticoids and TGF- in Con8 mammary tumor cells, has significant sequence homology to the product of the lethal (l) disc large-1 (dlg) gene of Drosophila(27, 34) which has been implicated as a tumor-suppressor gene. Drosophila mutations in dlg result in a loss of apical-basolateral epithelial cell polarity and in a stimulation of neoplastic growth(35) . Recent evidence has implicated other junctional components, adhesion molecules, and integral membrane proteins as potential tumor suppressors (34, 36, 37) or interactions with tumor suppressor proteins, such as -catenin's direct interaction with APC(38, 39) . Thus, in mammalian cells, the hormonal control of junctional plaque proteins, such as ZO-1, may play a key role in suppression of a malignant phenotype by modulating growth factor receptor signal transduction pathways involved in tumor proliferation, dedifferentiation, or

 One of the best-characterized pathways that is responsible for the propagation of mitogenic signals from the cell surface to the nucleus is that involving the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) or mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The ERKs are important elements in a signaling cascade that includes upstream protein kinases such as Raf and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) (5, 9, 19). Activation of the ERKs is known to target numerous cellular proteins, including downstream protein kinases, such as 90-kDa S6 kinase (RSK) (5, 9, 19) and transcription factors like Elk-1 and Sap-1a, which regulate the activity of the promoter of the early response gene c-fos (33). The protooncogene c-fos is expressed within minutes of cell activation (6, 16, 21, 33) and plays an important role in the process of transmission, amplification, and integration of the extracellular signals (6, 16, 21, 33).

 In H.&nbsp;brasiliensis, rubber synthesis takes place on the surface of rubber particles suspended in the latex (the cytoplasm of laticifers). The laticifers are specialized vessels that are located adjacent to the phloem of the rubber tree. When severed during tapping, the high turgor pressure inside the laticifers expels latex containing 30-50% (w/w) cis-1,4-polyisoprene. The latex can be fractionated by centrifugation into three phases: the top fraction containing mostly rubber particles, the metabolically active middle fraction (called C-serum), and the bottom fraction of mainly vacuole-like organelles called lutoids. More than 240&nbsp;expressed sequence tags (ESTs)1 have been identified from the latex of H.&nbsp;brasiliensis2 Kush et al. (2) have shown differential expression of several rubber biosynthesis-related genes in latex. The rubber elongation factor (REF), an enzyme involved in rubber biosynthesis (3), is highly expressed in laticifers (4). Laticiferous cells actively translate the transcribed genes into proteins. About 200&nbsp;distinct polypeptides are present in the latex of H.&nbsp;brasiliensis (5). Arokiaraj et al. (6) observed that the GUS reporter gene introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was expressed in the latex of the transgenic Hevea plant. Genes expressed in the latex of Hevea can be divided into three groups based on the proteins they encode: 1) defense-related proteins such as hevein (7), chitinase (8), -1,3-glucanase (9), and HEVER (10); 2) rubber biosynthesis-related proteins such as REF (4), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (11), and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (12); and 3) latex allergens (proteins) such as Hev b 3&nbsp;(13), Hev b 4,&nbsp;Hev b 5&nbsp;(14, 15), and Hev b 7&nbsp;(16). Biological functions of the allergenic proteins are largely unknown.

Conclusions References &nbsp; In an experimental study conducted on isolated mouse proximal tubule segments and cultured proximal tubule cells, the authors made the hypothesis that direct tubular toxicity may result from alterations in the integrity of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes [33]. Contact of the CM with tubular cells seems to cause a rapid loss of cellular proteins in the suspension medium, including the loss of cell membrane proteins, such as the sodium&#150;potassium ATPase pump and caveolin, as well as mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome C. Some authors have also proposed that CM may induce increased susceptibility of the cell membrane to the attack of phospholipase A2, an enzyme able to induce deacylation, which is an important process in ischaemia and cellular hypoxic damage.

 First, we isolated COPII vesicles from in vitro reactions using ER membranes prepared from the Erv14p-HA- tagged strain CBY409. If Erv14p is an authentic Erv protein, it should be selectively packaged into vesicles only when COPII proteins are included in the incubation. Under reconstituted budding conditions (Fig. 2 B), ER-derived vesicles incorporated Erv14p-HA at a level (~12%) comparable to other characterized vesicle proteins, such as Sec22p (Barlowe et al., 1994; Rexach et al., 1994) and Erv25p (Belden and Barlowe, 1996). Resident ER proteins, such as Sec12p and Sec61p (not shown), were not packaged into COPII-coated vesicles under these conditions. In this experiment, [35S]glycopro--factor was released at an efficiency of 23% in the presence of COPII proteins and 3% in their absence. Thus, Erv14p satisfies the initial criteria of an Erv protein such that this species is selectively exported from ER membranes under conditions that reconstitute vesicle budding.

 The enhanced ERE-mediated transactivation observed in LTED breast cancer cells could reflect increased receptor number exclusively or, in addition, modulation of processes distal to receptor binding. Thus, an increased concentration of ER could be the sole explanation for the enhanced ER-mediated transactivation observed. Other adaptive processes could also be taking place in the LTED cells. Increased phosphorylation of the ER or of coactivator proteins could serve to enhance ER-mediated transactivation. This process could involve up-regulation of PKC, PKA, MAP kinase, or other pathways. Increased activity or up-regulation of integrator proteins, such as CBP or coactivator proteins other than SRC-1, could also increase ER-mediated transactivation. A reduction of suppressor proteins, such as SMRT (40), N-CoR (41), or ERE-binding inhibitory proteins (42), could also induce the same effect. These additional processes could act to amplify the effects of increased ER number in enhancing ERE-mediated transcription.

 The rapid loss of dystrophin seen in the present study is consistent with models of force transduction within fibers (16, 40, 42), as well as findings from other studies that examine cytoskeletal changes (2, 8, 11, 26). A rapid and specific loss of dystrophin labeling has also been reported in ischaemically injured cardiomyocytes without affecting dystrophin-associated proteins, such as -sarcoglycan, -dystroglycan, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger membrane-protein (2, 7). A selective loss of dystrophin (30%) without concomitant loss of other cytoskeletal proteins such as desmin or -actinin has also been reported after using a hindlimb suspension-reloading model in rats (11). More severe disruptions of dystrophin, including -sarcoglycan, -dystroglycan, and -sarcoglycan, have been shown in severe and vigorous exercise regimens. It is important to note that contractile function was not assessed in any of the above studies, and it is unclear whether the altered morphology was associated with decreased contractile function.

 Vesicular transport through the secretory pathway undergoes a number of discrete steps each involving budding, membrane remodeling, targeting, docking, and fusion. In ER to Golgi transport, anterograde cargo proteins such as VSVG are selectively transported to the Golgi along with resident ER proteins with the latter retrieved by a salvage process that recognizes distinct motifs within the protein (3). These transport vesicles contain an electron-dense coat assembled under the control of the small GTPase ARF (4). The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits ARF activation by stabilizing the inactive ARF-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex (5) resulting in retrograde transport of Golgi content to the ER. At the Golgi complex, cargo proteins destined for post-Golgi locations are sorted into distinct carriers upon exit from the trans face, whereas Golgi resident proteins such as mannosidase II (Man II) are selectively retrieved in COPI-coated vesicles and returned to the cis face (6).

 Actin filament length, like myosin filament length, is actively regulated by the contractile state of the cell (55). In addition, many different growth factors, cytokines, and other mediators promote actin polymerization (72, 92) (Fig. 4). The signaling pathways activated by these mediators converge on the RhoA family of proteins, such as RhoA and Cdc42, which facilitate actin polymerization in concert with members of the Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome (WASp/Scar) family (66) and formin homology proteins such as mDia (74). These proteins act through their proline-rich domains to activate profilin, which directly organizes actin monomer addition (11). Other proteins that contribute to actin polymerization by activating profilin include ezrin and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). The process of actin polymerization is held in check by proteins that cap the actin ends (and thus slow further monomer addition or prevent monomer removal), such as HSP27, CapZ/Cap, tropomodulin, and SM-Lmod (for review, see Ref. 82).

 Low-molecular-weight plasma proteins such as albumin and 2-microglobulin are reabsorbed via a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway by proximal tubules and are then delivered to lysosomes for degradation (25). The luminal uptake of albumin requires the presence of binding proteins such as megalin (gp330) as the first step in the endocytic cascade (9). The transport of albumin and other low-molecular-weight proteins into endocytic vesicles also depends on the appropriate endosomal acidification, which is accomplished by the transport of protons through a V-type H+-ATPase (25). For the supply of the required amounts of counterions, channels like the recently discovered chloride channel ClC-5 are indispensable to guarantee the appropriate chloride influx into endosomes (17, 25). Defective ClC-5 function caused by mutations in the respective gene therefore leads to impaired endosomal acidification and consequently to low-molecular-weight proteinuria, as found in Dent's disease and related syndromes (22, 23).

 Apoptosis is a gene-regulated mechanism of cell death that is essential for elimination of unwanted cells in various biological systems in most metazoans. Apoptosis is driven by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases, which process various cellular proteins to execute apoptotic cell death (for review see Thornberry and Lazebnik 1998 ). The Bcl-2 family of proteins are well-characterized regulators of apoptosis, consisting of three distinct subfamilies (for reviews see Adams and Cory 1998 ; Green and Reed 1998 ; Tsujimoto and Shimizu 2000a , Tsujimoto and Shimizu 2000b ). (a) The Bcl-2 subfamily contains antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which show sequence homology at the Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 1, BH2, and BH3 domains, as well as at the BH4 domain in most cases. (b) The Bax subfamily contains proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, which show sequence homology at BH1, BH2, and BH3. (c) BH3-only proteins are another subfamily of proapoptotic proteins that only share homology at the BH3 domain, such as Bid, Bik, and Bim. It has been shown that in addition to BH1 and BH2, the BH4 domain is required for the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, whereas the BH3 domain of proapoptotic proteins is essential, and sufficient, for proapoptotic activity (for reviews see Adams and Cory 1998 ; Tsujimoto and Shimizu 2000a , Tsujimoto and Shimizu 2000b ). Many of the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (such as Bax, Bid, Bim, and Bad) are localized in the cytoplasm of living cells, but during apoptosis, translocate to the mitochondria through various modifications of these proteins, such as proteolytic cleavage and dephosphorylation, probably leading to conformational changes (for review see Tsujimoto 1998 ).

 In this study, we have considered the delivery of the syntaxin Pep12p to endosomes. Two functionally distinct endosomal compartments can be distinguished, which we refer to as early and late endosomes. Early endosomes are the site from which some endocytosed proteins (such as the SNARE Snc1p) are retrieved to the Golgi (Lewis et al. 2000 ). Late Golgi proteins such as Kex2p and the SNAREs (Tlg1p and Tlg2p) are also thought to recycle through this compartment, which makes it difficult to distinguish from late Golgi cisternae. Late endosomes are easier to identify&#151;they contain Pep12p and also show a characteristic coalescence into a large perivacuolar structure termed the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) in class E vps mutants (reviewed by Conibear and Stevens 1998 ). In wild-type cells, late endosomes appear to mature into multivesicular bodies that then fuse with the vacuole (Odorizzi et al. 1998a ), and this constitutes the main mechanism by which proteins reach the vacuole.

 In summary, in the current work we present evidence that non-discriminative administration of a dominant negative mutant of Rho proteins such as T17NRac1 may cause a nonspecific effect on multiple Rho GTPase-regulated signaling pathways. We have identified a conserved pair of amino acid residues of the Trio-Rac complex that is essential to the GEF catalysis of Rho GTPases, providing insights into the catalytic mechanism of Rho GTPase activation reaction. We offer an alternative to dominant negative Rho GTPases, the dominant negative regulator of Rho proteins such as N1406ATrioN, as a new generation of Rho GTPase pathway-specific inhibitors. We expect that the future design of a dominant negative mutant similar to N1406A of TrioN made in the full-length backbone of the Dbl family GEFs may provide more valuable pathway-specific inhibitors that are useful for the dissection of sophisticated signal transmission through individual Rho proteins in the complex cell signaling paradigms.

 One of the possible mechanisms of p65 phosphorylation at its TA domain in controlling its transcriptional competency is to recruit coactivator proteins such as histone acetyl transferases (71, 72) and TLS (73) to NF-B when it binds to the target promoter sequence. Alternatively, p65 phosphorylation may preclude the recruitment of corepressor proteins such as Groucho family proteins that is known to interact with the p65 TA domain (48) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (74-77). For example, it was reported that cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of p65 caused the p65 association with CBP in vitro (72). The same group has recently demonstrated with cultured cells that p65 was associated with HDAC-1 in unstimulated cells, and it was dissociated from HDAC1 but associated with CBP upon cotransfection with the PKA catalytic subunit (77). Thus, it is possible that p65 phosphorylation may act as a determinant for selecting the interacting partner of NF-B.

 As in vertebrate cell death models, members of the Bcl-2 family can be grouped into three functional classes in yeast. The first group comprises proteins, such as Bax and Bak, which are lethal per se. The second group includes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1, which bind to and suppress Bax and Bak lethality. The third group bind to anti- but not pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. These proteins, which include Bad, Bcl-xS, and the C.&nbsp;elegans Ced-9, are functionally inactive in terms of direct killing or death suppression. In vertebrates, proteins such as Bad and Bcl-xS are not considered to be lethal per se but rather are thought to potentiate killing by binding to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (29, 30). Thus, mammalian Bcl-2 family members have the same spectrum of biological activities in yeast as they do in vertebrate cells.

 It has been proposed that formation of v-SNARE/t-SNARE fusion complexes is regulated by the association of the SNAREs with other proteins such as synaptophysin (VAMP), Munc-18 (syntaxin), and synaptotagmin (reviewed in 22 . Our preliminary data suggest that neither VAMP-2 or cellubrevin are associated with any proteins in complexes that are resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization (Fig. 6) under conditions that should preserve interactions between the VAMPs and proteins such as synaptophysin (45). Recently, several isoforms of syntaxin (43) and Munc-18 (46) have been identified in the plasma membranes of rat adipocytes. It will be interesting to see whether insulin regulates the interaction of syntaxin and regulatory proteins. Determination of the mechanism by which the VAMPs in the intracellular vesicles are prevented from interacting with their cognate t-SNAREs, the syntaxins, at the plasma membrane may yield important insights into the mechanism of regulation of glucose transport by insulin.

 Similarly to dynamin, interaction of N-WASP with endocytic effector proteins such as pacsins/syndapins or intersectin occurs via their SH3 domains binding to a proline-rich region within the N-WASP sequence (Hussain et al., 2001; Modregger et al., 2000; Qualmann et al., 1999). For N-WASP, interaction with SH3-containing proteins is one of several possible modes of activation. N-WASP is intrinsically inactive owing to an auto-inhibited conformation in which the N-terminal regulatory domain blocks the C-terminal Arp2/3 activating domain (Kim et al., 2000). Auto-inhibition can be released by many activators, the best characterized example being cooperative binding of the small GTPase Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Caron, 2002). Alternatively, either Cdc42 or PIP2 may synergize with SH3-containing proteins, such as Grb2 or the recently discovered Toca-1, to stimulate interaction of N-WASP with Arp2/3 (Carlier et al., 2000; Ho et al., 2004).

 The regulation of cell death by reversible phosphorylation has been appreciated recently. The phosphorylation state of several mitochondrial proteins such as the antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl) and proapoptotic (BAD, Bid, Bik) Bcl-2 proteins regulates their cellular activity and, therefore, cell survival and cell death (56). It is tempting to speculate that in addition to its translocase activity, human Tim50 might also function as a phosphatase for certain mitochondrial proteins such as the Bcl-2 family members to regulate the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at serine 70 is required for Bcl-2 full and potent antiapoptotic function (57). A similar post-transcriptional modification was observed in other Bcl-2 family members, such as the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bad, Bid, and Bik (58-62). Thus, dephosphorylation of these proteins by human Tim50 might affect their biological activity in the outer mitochondrial membrane.

 Transcriptional repression mediated by CTIP1 did not appear to be sensitive to inhibition by TSA, suggesting that histone deacetylation, which has been implicated in transcriptional repression mediated by many other classes of transcription factors, including nuclear receptors (29, 30) and some C2H2 zinc finger proteins such as YY1 (47), may not underlie the action of CTIP1. The mechanism(s) underlying transcriptional repression mediated by CTIP1 in mammalian cells is unknown but may involve interaction with and disruption of the function of the general transcription machinery (48, 49), interaction with chromatin components, or remodeling factors resulting in stabilization of inactive chromatin structure (50), titration of transcriptional coactivators such as p300 and CBP (46), interaction with general corepressor proteins such as Groucho (51) or CtBP2 (52), recruitment of general repressors such as NC2 (53), inhibition of the assembly of the transcriptional preinitiation complex through interaction with TATA binding protein (reviewed in Ref. 54), and/or a novel mechanism.

 The spontaneous insertion pathway is of significant interest, and, given the operation of broadly similar SRP- and Sec-dependent pathway in bacteria, we predict that bacterial membrane proteins will emerge with similar insertion mechanisms. Further work on this topic is certainly merited to unravel the crucial early events in this particular insertion process, and it will be especially important to determine whether soluble factors other than SRP are involved in the soluble phase of the pathway. The lack of requirement for ATP or GTP precludes several obvious candidate "chaperone" proteins such as FtsY or members of the Hsp60 or Hsp70 family, and it is therefore possible that this type of protein can maintain insertion-competence without the aid of soluble factors. Very little is known about this element of the insertion pathway, or indeed about the actual insertion event, but proteins such as Elip2 and PsbS may be good subjects for this form of analysis. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;FOOTNOTES

 Finally, our results suggest a protein-protein interaction between ecNOS and calreticulin in porcine PAEC. The existence of such a complex would provide a cellular construct for understanding how ANG IV-mediated increases in calreticulin result in ecNOS activation. Although the precise nature of the interaction between ecNOS and calreticulin remains to be determined, it is possible that the Ca2+ binding site of ecNOS protein may be conformationally changed by calreticulin. If this is so, it appears that such a molecular interaction might enhance the effect of calmodulin on the catalytic activity of ecNOS. Alternatively, an increased level of calreticulin may enhance the potential interactions between ecNOS and other proteins, such as heat shock protein 90,&nbsp;reported to be involved in ecNOS activation (12). This possibility is supported by reports that calreticulin can interact with other proteins such as nuclear hormone receptors, integrin -subunit, and steroid hormone receptors, resulting in modulation of their function (5, 8, 19).

 Within the last two years, several interactions between NMDA receptor subunits and structural proteins such as SAPs and -actinin have been described and proposed to be involved in localizing NMDA receptors at synaptic junctions (16, 17, 28). However, NMDA and AMPA receptors behave quite different with respect to their solubilization properties and probably depend on different sets of structural proteins for synaptic localization. NMDA receptor subunits can be solubilized with Triton X-100 from a membrane fraction that is probably derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. NR1 subunits in this fraction are not yet associated with other components of the NMDA receptor complex (11). However, the mature NMDA receptors present in synaptic membrane fractions require the ionic detergents deoxycholate or SDS for extraction as do their partner SAPs. Furthermore, these two detergents do not disrupt the interactions between NMDA receptors and SAPs. It is, therefore, possible that the interactions between NMDA receptor subunits and SAPs are part of a large postsynaptic matrix that can only be broken up by strong ionic detergents, possibly due to the presence of additional interactions with other proteins such as guanylate kinase-associated proteins/ SAP90/PSD-95-associated proteins, -actinin, or with the cortical cytoskeleton. AMPA receptors may not be so tightly integrated into this matrix; alternatively, the interactions between components of the AMPA receptor complex and the NMDA receptor complex may be dissociated by SDS. It is tempting to speculate whether the interactions between AMPA receptor subunits and structural proteins such as SAP97 or GRIP are less rigid than those between NMDA receptors and SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102, chapsyn-110/PSD-93 or -actinin, thus allowing a larger degree of flexibility and plasticity for AMPA receptor anchoring than for NMDA receptor anchoring.

 The contributions of a number of kinases and docking/adaptor proteins to the signaling capacity of focal adhesions have been elucidated. For example, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and family members are tyrosine kinases that localize to focal adhesion sites, undergo autophosphorylation following integrin receptor engagement and contribute to focal adhesion regulation (Schlaepfer and Hunter, 1998). Members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases localize with FAK and phosphorylate components of focal adhesions (Schlaepfer and Hunter, 1998). Significantly, modulation of FAK signaling affects both cell motility and the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that these cellular processes have components in common (Frisch et al., 1996; Hungerford et al., 1996; Ilic et al., 1995). Substrates of FAK and Src (Hanks and Polte, 1997), which include actin binding proteins such as paxillin and adaptor proteins such as Crk and the Cas (Crk-associated substrate) family of signaling proteins, have become the targets of scrutiny as FAK/Src effectors in these dual processes.

 Recent studies in mammalian cells have uncovered other mitochondrial proteins, such as Smac (Diablo) (10, 11) and the serine protease Omi (HtrA2) (12-15), whose release from the mitochondria contributes to apoptosis. Both Smac and Omi can bind to IAPs via a conserved N-terminal IAP binding motif (16). Interestingly a similar IAP binding motif is present at the N terminus of the small subunit of mature caspase-9 (17), which is necessary for inhibition of caspase-9 by IAPs. Because of their ability to bind to IAPs, Smac and Omi could disrupt the caspase-IAP complexes thus freeing the active caspases to induce apoptosis (17). Moreover, Omi has been recently shown to directly degrade IAPs in human cells (18, 19). Other mitochondrial proteins such as AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and endonuclease G (Endo G) are also specifically released from the mitochondria and directly targeted to the nucleus causing chromatin condensation and large scale DNA fragmentation (20, 21).

 The Rho subfamily of small GTPases regulates diverse cellular processes via their specific effector proteins, which are either serine/threonine protein kinases such as ROCK, PKN1/PRK1, and citron kinase or scaffold proteins such as rhophilin, rhotekin, citron, and diaphanous (reviewed in Refs. 8-10). Among the best-characterized Rho effectors are ROCK proteins. Two ROCK isoforms, ROCKI/ROK/p160ROCK and ROCKII/ROK/Rho kinase, that share 65% overall identity and 95% homology have so far been identified (11-14). They were first found as mediators of stress fibers and focal adhesion formation (15), but further studies revealed that ROCK is involved in many other cellular processes including smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth (16, 17). Interest in the Rho-ROCK pathway emerges from the fact that abnormal activation of this pathway plays a role not only in tumor invasion and metastasis (18-20) but also in diseases such as hypertension and bronchial asthma (21, 22).

 Based on these results, we propose the following model of Arp2-mediated platelet actin polymerization.61 A soluble pool of Arp2/3 is recruited to the membrane upon agonist stimulation in the first stage, rounding, of activation. Activation of this Arp2/3 would produce an explosive burst of polymerization of new filaments at the cortex. Polymerization is aided by an increase in actin monomers resulting from gelsolin severing and capping of existing filaments,6-8,11,58,59 possibly facilitated by cofilin-mediated depolymerization.16,19,27 Dissociation of side-binding proteins such as VASP would potentiate severing and depolymerization6 and expose filament sides to serve as activation sites for Arp2/3. Subsequent barbed-end capping by capping protein62 or 2E4/kaptin5 would limit the length and location of new filament elongation. Filopodia and lamellipodia would then form as new filaments become networked by other actin-binding proteins, such as VASP,6,41 -actinin,63 or tropomyosin.64

 family AS A MEMBER OF THE EZRIN, RADIXIN, MOESIN (ERM) protein family, ezrin plays a role in mediating the binding of F-actin to the plasma membrane and thus is involved in many cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking, cell polarization, and motility. Ezrin also has been suggested as a participant in signal transduction through its tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Rho GTPases (reviewed in Refs. 8 and 22). All ERM proteins contain two ERM association domains (ERMADs): the N-ERMAD at the NH2 terminus is homologous to the membrane binding domain of the Band 4.1 protein family, and the C-ERMAD at the COOH terminus has an F-actin binding domain as previously demonstrated nicely in vivo and in vitro (2, 38). The binding of the N-ERMAD to membrane has proved a bit more complicated. Ezrin binds directly to some membrane proteins such as CD44, CD43, and several intercellular adhesion molecule isoforms (20, 33, 43). Ezrin also binds to membrane indirectly via adaptor molecules such as ezrin binding protein 50 (EBP50), also called Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) regulatory factor (NHERF)-1 (30, 31), or NHE type 3 (NHE3) kinase A-regulatory protein (E3KARP), also called NHERF-2 (36, 44). Both adaptor proteins have two postsynaptic density protein-95/Drosophila disk large, Dlg-1/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domains that bind to membrane proteins such as NHE3 (44) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (34), thus connecting ezrin to these transmembrane proteins. EBP50 and E3KARP also bind to other membrane proteins, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (29), parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (25), Cl&#150; channel 3 (19), and 2-adrenergic receptor (9) and therefore could also mediate possible indirect interactions between these proteins and ezrin.

 Expression Patterns during Early Stage Induction of the Differentiation Program&#151; Substantive changes in protein levels were detected immediately following induction of the myogenic program (day 2) by withdrawal of serum-derived mitogens, consistent with a major shift from cell division to terminal differentiation. Many of these proteins were detected exclusively at this stage, several of which are listed in Table III. These included marked up-regulation of proteins mapping to select functional categories (see Supplemental Table S7 for complete details), including the GO terms nucleus (55 proteins, such as vitamin D3 receptor, CpG-binding protein, mRNA-capping enzyme, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein), DNA-dependent regulation of transcription (20 proteins, including the Kruppel-like factor 4, homeobox protein Meis1, nuclear receptor corepressor 1, mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) 4, and lamin B receptor), and protein binding (35 proteins, such as neurogenic locus Notch homolog protein 3, syntaxin4, Rab6-interacting protein 2 isoform, myosin 5, and thyroid receptor-interacting protein).

 To extend previous reports that HSV-1 DNA is nucleosome free, we examined infected cells using two cellular imaging methods. First, we immunostained interphase and mitotic infected cells with antibodies that recognize histone H4 and a mitosis-specific epitope on histone H3. Viral replication compartments in both interphase and mitotic cells showed no detectable staining with antibodies that recognize histones H4 (Fig 3 a) or H3 (Fig 3 b). This absence of staining is in sharp contrast to the pronounced replication compartment staining seen for other host cell DNA-binding proteins such as RNAP II, basal transcription factors, p53, Rb, and DNA ligase, as well as for viral replication and regulatory proteins such as ICP4, ICP8, ICP27, and viral replication proteins (Wilcock and Lane 1991 ; Rice et al. 1994 ; Zhong and Hayward 1997 ; de Bruyn Kops et al. 1998 ). These data suggest that histones H3 and H4 do not contribute significantly to the protein complement of HSV nucleoprotein fibers.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Both cortical neurons and skeletal muscle are electrically specialized, post-mitotic tissues endowed with cholinergic synapses and internal calcium release channels and are uniquely disordered in Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 and inclusion body myositis (IBM), respectively. Deposits of AD-associated proteins, such as -amyloid peptide (A), hyperphosphorylated Tau, and other shared misfolded proteins, such as, -amyloid precursor protein (APP), ubiquitin, as well as various chaperones and kinases are thought to play pathologic roles in the cognitive decline (1) and muscular failure (2), which define these incurable human conditions. Ca2+ ions play essential roles in numerous cellular processes. The release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores and the influx of Ca2+ through the surface membrane ion channels and transporters are critical to both memory formation and contraction in their cognate tissues (3). The prolonged elevation of cellular Ca2+ has been shown to be deleterious to neuronal and muscle function (4).

 The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of two extracellular subunits (135 kDa each) and two transmembrane subunits (95 kDa each) that function as allosteric enzymes in which the subunit inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the subunit. Insulin binding to the subunit relieves the inhibition of the kinase activity in the subunit leading to autophosphorylation of the subunits and a conformational change that further increases the kinase activity. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates proteins such as Shc and the insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 (165&#150;185 kDa) and IRS-2 (180&#150;190 kDa). IRS-1 and IRS-2 have a highly conserved amino terminus, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a carboxyl terminus with several tyrosine phosphorylation sites. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are complementary and act as "docking sites" to several Src homology 2 domains containing proteins, such as the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 (5).

 The results presented here and in previous literature suggest a unifying hypothesis for the activation of integrins. The receptor is proposed to be restrained in a resting state through an interaction involving the membrane-proximal region of the &nbsp;and &nbsp;cytoplasmic domains (6, 10, 23). The removal of either of these regions results in a constitutive activated receptor, and that activation is independent of other interactions of the &nbsp;cytoplasmic domains or cellular energy (7, 15, 42). Furthermore, introduction of the lipidated membrane-proximal sequence of the IIb tail (KVGFFKR) into platelets results in IIb3 activation, presumably by disrupting this membrane-proximal interaction (36). Thus, the membrane-proximal interaction forms a structural on-off switch for the receptor. However, normal activation mechanisms require the distal region of the 3 cytoplasmic domain (7, 9, 17, 27). An interaction of talin with the 3 cytoplasmic domain can activate the receptor, and this depends on membrane distal sequences (14). The present results indicate interactions between the membrane distal IIb sequence and the 3 tail within the native receptor that block integrin activation. Disruption of this membrane distal interaction could account for energy and &nbsp;tail-dependent activation caused by alterations in membrane-distal &nbsp;cytoplasmic domain sequences (7, 42). Furthermore, the interaction with the IIb tail may oppose stabilization of the reverse turn at 3(Asn744-Tyr747) by cytoplasmic proteins such as talin. Thus, detailed analyses of the structural effects of interactions of proteins, such as talin, with integrin &nbsp;cytoplasmic domains are likely be informative in testing this model of integrin activation. In addition, the identification of physiologic mechanisms that regulate the interactions of integrin tails with each other and with proteins such as talin will be central to the understanding of this important biological process. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 CD21 &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References &nbsp; Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease that predominantly affects the joints. Diagnosis is based on symptoms related to synovial inflammation, the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and radiological signs of joint damage [1]. The aetiology of RA is still unknown. In the extremely complex pathophysiology, innate immunity may play an important role [2]. RF has been established as a useful serological marker for diagnosis, and a variety of other serum parameters, e.g. acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, indicate disease activity. Recently, a combination of RF and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide was reported as a possible diagnostic tool to differentiate between RA and undifferentiated polyarthritis [3]. Markers of increased connective tissue turnover and certain soluble membrane-bound proteins, such as soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, soluble CD4, IL-6, -1-antitrypsin and complement activation products, are elevated in RA [4].

 The impact of the G/HDAC5 interaction on signaling through MEF2C may be secondary to a yet to be discovered role for the interaction near the plasma membrane. It is abundantly clear that histones are not the only proteins impacted by the activity of HDACs (11). Numerous transcription factors, including STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3) (43) and p53 (44), are acetylated; autoacetylation of HATs can impact catalysis and protein-protein interactions (11, 45), and the roles of acetylation of proteins such as importin- have yet to be determined (46). Association with HATs and HDACs has been reported to affect the biological roles of extranuclear proteins such as endothelin receptor A (20) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (47), but the acetylated substrates mediating these effects have not been identified. In mediating the interaction of HDAC5 with other factors, G thus may be relieving MEF2C of a small portion of its complement of class II HDACs, leading to our observations.

 One mechanism whereby SH2-B recruitment of Rac to cytokine receptor-JAK complexes or receptor tyrosine kinases might regulate the cytoskeleton is by bringing Rac into close proximity to the appropriate GEFs. GEFs are often recruited to activated cytokine receptor-JAK complexes or growth factor receptors (38, 39). Recruitment of Rac to plasma membrane receptors as a consequence of binding to SH2-B would also position Rac near the appropriate part of the actin cytoskeleton for regulating cell motility. Previous studies have indicated that although Rac can be found in the cytoplasm, coupling of small GTPases to their effector pathways in cells generally requires their membrane association (40, 41). One can also envision SH2-B facilitating ligand activation of the actin cytoskeleton by binding not only Rac but also other proteins important for the actions of Rac on the actin cytoskeleton, for example, Rac effector proteins, such as PAK (42, 43) or Rac modulatory proteins, such as DOCK 180&nbsp;(44).

 Further analysis of our sequenced clones in the Myeloma Gene Index reveals some relevant findings of note in myeloma biology and reveals novel gene sequences of potential interest to the field. As one example, a list of receptors and growth factors that are expressed in myeloma was compiled and arrayed. This list includes the IL-6 receptor and the newly identified TNF-related cytokine BLyS/BAFF&nbsp;14,15 together with its receptors, TACI and BCMA.21-23 Binding of BLyS to its receptor provides survival signals to activated B cells by up-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and down-regulation of proapoptotic protein such as Bim.21-23,39 In this light, a cDNA clone of potential interest encoding a putative novel gene with homology to BH3-only protein BimL (PCL5805) was also identified in our sequencing effort. It is not yet known whether this gene is also a downstream target for the BlyS/BAFF signaling pathway.

 detected. &nbsp; Down-regulated Cellular Functions&#151; Table V highlights notable proteins belonging to several major functional categories significantly down-regulated as a function of cessation of cell division and the process of cell differentiation. These categories included cell cycle (22 proteins, such as cyclin T, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, Cullin-3, and septins 2 and 5&#150;7, and septin-like protein Sint1), DNA replication (16 proteins, including DNA replication licensing factors MCM2&#150;4, -6, and -7 and various chromatin assembly factors), DNA topoisomerase activity (two proteins, including DNA topoisomerases II and &#223; isozymes), and chromatin (nine proteins, such as high mobility group 1 and 2 proteins, SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily C member 1, histone deacetylase 1, and Tousled-like kinase). The largest decreases occurred for proteins involved in protein synthesis and mRNA processing during later stages of myotube formation, consistent with the reduced growth rate of the postmitotic cells (see Supplemental Table S9 for complete details).

 In the UV-visible absorption spectrum of P2Y FeIII CooA at pH 7.4&nbsp;(Fig. 1A), a spin equilibrium is evident in that there is a split Soret peak at 388&nbsp;and 423&nbsp;nm, denoting five-coordinate, high-spin and six-coordinate, low-spin fractions, respectively. In addition, there is an enhanced peak with the FeIII P2Y CooA variant at 640&nbsp;nm (relative to that of WT CooA), often associated with high-spin, five-coordinate hemes. Low-spin FeIII heme proteins, such as cyano-Met sperm whale Mb (35) and b-type cytochromes (36) typically have Soret peaks from 422&nbsp;to 429&nbsp;nm, while high-spin FeIII heme proteins, such as those found in catalase (37) and FixL (38) have Soret peaks from 391&nbsp;to 417&nbsp;nm. While the data suggests that some fraction of the P2Y FeIII CooA exists as a high-spin, five-coordinate thiolate linkage, other hypotheses are possible and this issue is pursued below with EPR spectroscopy.

 In addition to its well-documented effects elicited through signal transduction cascades, recent studies have shown that PTHrP also acts in an intracrine fashion after translocation to the nucleus or nucleolus (23, 27, 28, 29, 30). Immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy studies have localized PTHrP in the nuclear compartment of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 8), as well as in keratinocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, transfected COS cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (23, 27, 28, 29). Nuclear translocation is dependent on the presence of a bipartite NLS, which consists of two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer (10-residue) (31). The NLS is found in some transcription factors (such as c-fos and c-jun), various nuclear proteins (such as p53, CDC16, and Ab1), several steroid hormone receptors [such as the thyroid &#223;, glucocorticoid , and androgen receptors (22, 31)], growth factors [such as members of the fibroblast growth factor family (61)], and human retroviral proteins [such as the HIV Tat protein (62)].

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; DNA-damaging agents have been widely used for inducing apoptosis in tumor cells in anticancer therapy for decades. The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the key regulators of DNA damage-induced cell death. Upon DNA damage, the activity of p53 is rapidly increased through several post-translational mechanisms, including stabilization of the p53 protein by inactivation of MDM2 and direct modifications of p53 by phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation (1&#150;4). As a transcription factor, p53 induces the expression of the cell cycle regulator protein p21 and pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, NOXA, and PUMA (5&#150;8) and inhibits the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin (9&#150;11). Moreover, p53-mediated cell death can also be achieved independently of its transcriptional activity by the binding of p53 to mitochondrial proteins such as Bcl-XL and BAK (12&#150;14). The p53-BAK complex formation coincides with the loss of the interaction between BAK and an anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 and leads to the oligomerization of BAK and the subsequent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (14). The proline-rich domain of p53 is not required for its transcriptional activity but is essential for its apoptosis-inducing function in many cell types (12, 15, 16). There are two PXXPXP motifs, the perfect ligands for the Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domains (17&#150;19), in the proline-rich domain of human p53. However, to date no SH3 domain-containing protein has been reported to bind to this region, although tyrosine kinase c-Abl has been shown to interact with the PXXP motif in p73, and such interaction is important for p73-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage (20&#150;22).

 As shown by Western blotting, only the C/EBP14 isoform is expressed by mature blood eosinophils (at very high levels). Genes encoding MBP and other secondary granule proteins such as eosinophil peroxidase are down-regulated and ultimately silenced as eosinophils terminally differentiate and mature (106). These findings are consistent with a negative regulatory role for the C/EBP14 isoform in eosinophil terminal differentiation, because it lacks a transactivation or repressor domain and may act as a dominant negative regulator either by occupying the C/EBP sites in the promoters of eosinophil secondary granule protein genes, such as MBP, or by heterodimerizing with other C/EBPs (i.e. C/EBP or -), forming a functionally inactive dimer. The C/EBP27 isoform, which contains both transactivation and repression domains as described above, may also act as a repressor in this process to decrease MBP gene transcription until the expression of other key regulators such as GATA-1 has ceased in the mature eosinophil (Fig. 11).

 Although we know that the annexin II tetramer interacts with proteases and matrix proteins on the cell surface, how these interactions affect the extracellular matrix degradation remains unknown. The annexin II tetramer also interacts with membrane proteins such as integrins (72) and caveolin (73). Recently, Wei et al. reported that urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor complexes with caveolin and 1 integrin on the cell surface (74). Such a common locus for these proteins is of potential functional importance, as cathepsin B has been shown to activate soluble and receptor-bound prourokinase (75). In this regard, in ovarian cancer cells, inhibition of cell surface cathepsin B prevents activation of prourokinase and, thereby, their invasion through Matrigel (75). Taken together, it is tempting to assume that the annexin II tetramer along with other proteins (such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, caveolins, and integrins) may serve as an organizer to localize various proteases to the cell surface and activate a proteolytic cascade(s). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 Cell polarity on the choroid plexus epithelia of Tg737orpk mutants Another potential pathogenic mechanism is altered cell polarity, similar to that seen for the kidneys of Tg737orpk mice, as well as of several other PKD mouse models, which have revealed a mislocalization of polarized proteins such as the EGF receptor and Na+/K+-ATPase (Wilson, 1997). In the kidney, this results in excess fluid accumulation in the tubules and the development of the cystic pathology (Avner, 1993; Wilson, 1997). Here, we analyzed sections of brains to determine the localization of -catenin and ZO-1 (Tjp1 &#150; Mouse Genome Informatics), indicators of general polarity as well as of transport proteins such as the Na+/K+-ATPase and the anion exchanger 2 (Fig. 7). The data indicate that all of these proteins were localized normally in the mutants and at similar levels to in the control samples. Thus, there were no overt defects in the organization of the tissue because of defects of the cilia.

 The concept of lipid rafts or membrane microdomains was originally proposed to explain the vectorial transport of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the apical surface in polarized cells.13,14 In the past decade, numerous studies have established the general characteristics of lipid rafts.15-18 These microdomains contain mainly cholesterol and sphingolipids as lipid constituents, which make them insoluble in nonionic detergents, and are specifically enriched in different sets of proteins, namely, GPI-anchored proteins such as Thy-1 and PrP; palmitoylated proteins such as G proteins, Src family kinases, and caveolins; tetraspanin proteolipids; and other signaling proteins. However, lipid rafts are heterogeneous in their specific lipid and protein content, and different types of rafts coexist at the plasma membrane, even within close proximity. This was first shown by Schnitzer et al,19 who separated caveolae, which are morphologically and functionally distinct lipid microdomains of the plasma membrane, from associated lipid rafts, which contain the bulk of GPI-linked proteins.

 A direct comparison between pressure and volume overload suggests that increased wall stress particular to each type of mechanical overload is the primary determinant of the hypertrophic phenotype (5, 13). In the case of LV pressure-overload hypertrophy, the molecular basis for altering the phenotype can be found in two distinct processes. The first is increased expression of specific mRNAs encoding proteins that directly affect cardiac growth and function. These include diverse classes of proteins such as transcription factors (20), growth factors (3), tubulin (38), and fetal isoforms of the myofibrillar proteins myosin and actin (7). The second process involves acceleration of the rate of protein synthesis to produce an overall increase in LV mass (31). The resultant hypertrophy of the individual cardiac muscle cells is characterized by increases in constitutively expressed proteins such as myosin and actin. The interplay of these two processes during hypertrophy enables plasticity of the cardiac phenotype in the setting of a compensatory increase in LV mass.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Rho proteins are GTP/GDP binding GTPases that belong to the Ras superfamily and are intimately involved in diverse cellular processes and diseases (1). For example, Rho proteins are pivotal in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton processes such as lamellipodia, fiber, and membrane ruffle formation (2, 3). Rho proteins also regulate signal transduction proteins such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) that are involved in the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase pathways (4). Most important is the involvement of Rho GTPases as mediators of proliferation and malignant transformation. For example, RhoA and Rac1 are critical for the G1/S cell division cycle traverse (5) and mediate oncogenic Ras malignant transformation (5, 6). In cellular and animal models Rho proteins such as RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoC have been implicated in invasion and metastasis, and RhoC has been shown to contribute to metastasis in clinical settings (5-7).

 Many mitochondrial precursor proteins are unusually hydrophobic (5), including proteins soluble in the matrix (such as the dehydrogenase Adh3), peripheral membrane proteins such as the -subunit of the F1-ATPase, and integral membrane proteins such as members of the carrier family. These proteins have been shown to require the Tom70 receptor for efficient import into mitochondria (6&#150;10). Many of these precursor proteins might make use of cytosolic chaperones (11), and recently, Tom70 was shown to act both as a receptor directly interacting with precursors and as a docking site for cytosolic forms of Hsp70. Tom70 is composed of multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs: a degenerate 34-amino-acid sequence widely characterized as mediators of protein-protein interactions (12, 13). Structurally, a single TPR motif forms a pair of antiparallel -helices that are often arranged in large super-helical arrays of between 3 and 20 repeats (14) that can form a contiguous surface suitable for binding to short segments of peptide ligand (15).

 As with other products of cystic kidney disease genes, nephrocystin is thought to function in the development and/or maintenance of fully differentiated polarized kidney tubular epithelia. Based on the results of this and earlier studies, we hypothesize that nephrocystin functions as part of a protein complex involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton at sites of epithelial cell-cell adhesion through its associations with actin-binding proteins such as filamin and actin-modulating signaling proteins such as CAS. The proper organization of the actin cytoskeletal network at cell-cell contact sites is clearly important for the establishment and maintenance of fully differentiated polarized epithelial cells. In addition to its role as a support structure, an intact actin cytoskeletal network is required for proper assembly of signaling complexes at sites of cell adhesion. Loss of nephrocystin function could result in defects in the actin cytoskeletal network and associated signaling proteins, leading ultimately to a disruption of tubular epithelial cell polarity and cyst formation. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 It has been shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway play critical roles in promotion of cell survival (28-31). PI3K phosphorylates the 3-OH position of the inositol ring in phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), generating PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Both PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1, which in turn activates downstream targets such as Akt and SGK (32, 33). Akt inhibits apoptosis by inactivating proapoptotic proteins such as Bad, caspase-9, forkhead, and Nur77 and by activating antiapoptotic proteins such as NF-B and cAMP-response element-binding protein (9, 10, 34-40). Recent studies have suggested that Akt inhibits apoptosis at a premitochondrial level because it inhibits cytochrome c release and alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential (41, 42). However, the mechanisms by which Akt inhibits the premitochondrial events of apoptosis are not fully understood (41).

 The identification of membrane vesicles as exosomes relies on various criteria. Their size ranges from 50 to 90 nm in diameter and following a negative staining they display a cup-shaped morphology by electron microscopy (EM). Biochemical and proteomic analysis on exosomes purified from the supernatants of several cells revealed the presence of common proteins (8&#150;10, 18, 19, 24&#150;26). These include cytosolic proteins such as Hsc73 and Hsc90, subunits of trimeric G proteins, Tsg101, several annexins, Rab guanosine triphosphatase, cytoskeletal proteins (actin, tubulin) and milk-fat globule (MFG)-E8 (or lactadherin). Membrane-bound proteins such as tetraspanin (CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82) and MHC class I molecules were also identified in exosomal preparations. Cell type-specific proteins have also been found in these preparations such as class II MHC and co-stimulatory molecules (CD86) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), von Willebrand factor or CD41a (GPIIb) on platelets (17), TCR on T cell-derived exosomes (14) and perforin or granzyme on CTLs (13).

 The actin cytoskeleton. Actin filaments also play a role in the intracellular movement of vesicles and organelles via accessory proteins such as myosin ATPases (31). It has been proposed that whereas microtubules are responsible for "long-range" transport processes in the cell, actin filaments are involved in the final steps of access of vesicles to the underside of the plasma membrane (4, 41, 94). An additional role of the actin-based cortical cell web might actually be to restrict unregulated access of vesicles to the membrane by forming a physical barrier that impedes vesicle movement. Only after an appropriate stimulus (e.g., a rise in intracellular calcium) that results in activation of actin-severing or remodeling proteins such as gelsolin can the barrier be loosened to permit vesicles to move toward the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by experimental data from several cell types that have demonstrated an increase in exocytosis after experimental or physiological actin depolymerization (46, 56, 57, 85, 118).

 Subcellular Compartment for ADAMTS4 Activation&#151;Furin is one of the best studied protein convertases for various precursor proteins, including membrane-anchored protein such as MT3-MMP, MT1-MMP, ADAM19, BACE, and Notch, or secreted proteins, such as MMP11 and BMP-1, in the constitutive secretory pathway (9-12, 34-36). Furin cycles between cell surface and TGN through a process regulated by its cytoplasmic domain (37), indicating that it cleaves its substrate mostly in TGN and potentially on cell membrane. Our data demonstrate that ADAMTS4 is mainly colocalized with furin in TGN, suggesting that furin cleaves proADAMTS4 in the TGN. Therefore, it is most likely that ADAMTS4 prodomain is removed before it is secreted to the surrounding tissues. Consistently, many extracellular matrix proteases, such as MT3-MMP, ADAM19, BMP-1, et al. have been demonstrated to be cleaved in TGN (9, 10, 36). The observed intracellular processing of ADAMTS4 by furin thus represents a well defined pathway which may be targeted for therapeutical interventions.

 In a previous report (9) we have shown that the endogenous amount of prenylated proteins such as geranylgeranyl and farnesyl proteins of H. halobium cells was too low to detect. However, we have also reported enzymatic formation of farnesyl Ras protein from Ras precursor protein and farnesyl diphosphate by 100,000 g supernatant of this bacterium(9) . Coupled together, it is concluded that H. halobium contains at least two kinds of isoprenoid-modified proteins besides retinal-linked proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin(21) , diphytanylglycerylated proteins, and prenylated proteins, with the former being the major one. It is conceivable that these lipid-modified proteins, irrespective of the location of their modification, share a common requirement of anchoring an otherwise hydrophilic polypeptide to the membrane via hydrophobic lipid moieties in a structurally diverse group of proteins in order to function at the membrane/aqueous interface. Further experiments are in progress to identify the specific diphytanylglycerylated proteins and elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of the new lipoproteins in Halobacteria.

 Thyr-1 domains are recognized as a unique sequence motif of ~60-80 residues, usually containing six conserved cysteine residues (12). These domains or modules are present in diverse families of proteins that include mosaic proteins such as thyroglobulin (11), membrane proteins such as p41 invariant chain (13), and unrelated binding proteins such as saxiphilin (6, 9) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (14). A few years ago, it was discovered that some proteins containing Thyr-1 modules function as inhibitors of the papain family of cysteine proteinases that include cathepsins B and L, e.g. p41 invariant chain fragment (15), chum salmon egg cysteine proteinase inhibitor (16), and equistatin (17). A common feature of these latter proteins containing either one (p41, egg cysteine proteinase inhibitor) or three (equistatin) Thyr-1 modules is an ability to inhibit a variety of papain-related cysteine proteinases with Ki values in the picomolar to nanomolar range. They have thus been classified as thyroglobulin type 1&nbsp;proteinase inhibitors, also called thyropins (19). In a recent development to this emerging picture of thyropin function, it was found that the sea anemone protein, equistatin, also inhibits an aspartic proteinase (20). Interestingly, the distinct proteinase inhibitor activities of equistatin reside on different Thyr-1 domains. Inhibition of cysteine proteinase activity is associated with the N-terminal Thyr-1 domain of equistatin, and inhibition of an aspartic proteinase, cathepsin D, is associated with one of the two C-terminal Thyr-1 domains (20). In contrast, thyroglobulin, a protein with 11&nbsp;Thyr-1 modules, and mouse nidogen (or entactin) with one Thyr-1 module, reportedly do not inhibit papain (16). These results suggest that various Thyr-1 modules contain specific structural features that determine anti-proteinase activity against certain papain-related or cathepsin D-related enzymes.

 We have clearly shown that the expression level of ribosomal proteins, including Sa, S8, S12, S18, S24, L13a, L18, L28, L32, and L35a, was significantly increased in association with the maturation of mucosal epithelia, including goblet cells and columnar cells. In addition, these ribosomal proteins were markedly decreased in colorectal cancer compared with normal mucosa. Seemingly these results are paradoxical, because it has been generally accepted that ribosomal proteins are abundantly transcribed in actively proliferating cells, such as cancer cells. However, a recent study using DNA microarray analysis clearly demonstrates that many ribosomal proteins, such as S8, S24, and L32, are much more abundantly expressed in differentiated ovarian tumor cells than in less-differentiated ones (Welsh et al. 2000 ). The IHC results presented in this study provide further evidence that, in human colorectum, biosynthesis of many ribosomal proteins, such as Sa, S8, S12, S18, S24, L13a, L18, L28, L32, and L35a, is downregulated in actively proliferating cells such as immature mucosal epithelia and cancer cells.

 The benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotics geldanamycin and herbimycin were first isolated from the culture broths of several actinomycete species (14, 15) and described as inhibitors of tyrosine kinase-dependent growth (16, 17). These compounds, particularly geldanamycin, have tumorical activity toward numerous tumor cell lines (18), including those that overexpress ErbB-2 (19). This action toward tumor cell lines is attributed to the capacity of geldanamycin to induce the degradation of several important signal transducers important in mitogenic pathways. These targets include protein kinases, such as Src, Raf, FAK, and ErbB-2, and other growth regulating proteins, such as p53 (20). The mechanism for the geldanamycin-induced degradation of these various molecules is centered on the Hsp90 family of chaperones, because Hsp90 is the major intracellular protein that binds geldanamycin (20, 21). Geldanamycin has been shown to dissociate Hsp90 from various proteins and thereby inhibit their function, such as the nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors, or to induce their metabolic degradation, such as Src, Raf, and p53.

 The properties of MARCKS, including cross-linking F-actin and binding to plasma membrane, suggest that MARCKS regulates actin-membrane interaction and in turn maintains cell shape and motility. Consistent with this hypothesis, MARCKS is phosphorylated during chemotaxis, secretion, and phagocytosis in neutrophils and macrophages (18, 19), during neurosecretion (20, 21), and during mitogenesis (22, 23). PKC-dependent phosphorylation is possibly involved in functional roles of MARCKS. However, accumulating evidence has suggested that MARCKS is also an in vivo and in vitro substrate of proline-directed protein kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cycline-dependent protein kinase (cdk) 5.&nbsp;A mass spectroscopic analysis of intact MARCKS purified from bovine brain revealed at least 6&nbsp;phosphorylation sites in the Ser-Pro motif in the N-terminal domain and upstream of the phosphorylation sites for PKC (24). Furthermore, the proline-directed protein kinases, such as MAP kinase (25) and cdc2 kinase or cdk5 (26), can phosphorylate recombinant mouse MARCKS and purified rat MARCKS, respectively.

 Lately, much interest has been focused on the various granule types of neutrophils and their sequential mobilization during the inflammatory process (for review, see reference 5). Analysis of these granules by electron microscopy and subcellular fractionation has demonstrated that neutrophils have at least 4&nbsp;different granule or vesicle types.6-9 These are the primary or azurophilic granules that contain myeloperoxidase (MPO), bactericidal proteins, and proteinases; the secondary or specific granules that store lactoferrin and enzymes such as collagenase and gelatinase; the tertiary or gelatinase granules that, like specific granules, contain tissue-degrading enzymes; and the secretory vesicles, an easily mobilizable compartment, that contain alkaline phosphatase and plasma proteins such as human serum albumin. The 4&nbsp;granule types are mobilized at different stages of the inflammatory process; secretory vesicles are more readily secreted than the other granule types. Currently, it is believed that secretory vesicles release their content when neutrophils establish the primary rolling contact with the endothelium. Because the membrane of secretory vesicles is enriched with proteins such as Mac-1, complement receptor 1&nbsp;(CD35), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, the fusion of this compartment with the plasma membrane leads to an up-regulation of important receptors and adhesion factors to the neutrophil surface.5 Tertiary and secondary granules contain tissue-degrading enzymes and are less easily mobilized than secretory vesicles. Possibly, these compartments are involved in the regulation of the tissue remodeling processes that occur during the egress of neutrophils from the vasculature and into the tissue. Finally, azurophilic granules contain bactericidal proteins such as bactericidal permeability increasing protein, cathepsins, defensins, elastase, lysozyme, and proteinase 3.&nbsp;These proteins have important functions at the site of infection, where azurophilic granules fuse with phagosome compartments4,10 in some instances, these granules release their content extracellularly to achieve microbial killing.

 Although the binding of an oxonol analogue of WW781, diBA(5)C4, is mutually exclusive with the disulfonic stilbene, DNDS (Knauf et al. 1995 ), the different effects of [Cl-] on the affinity of DNDS (Frohlich 1982 ) as compared with diBA(5)C4 (Knauf et al. 1995 ) and WW781 (Figure 3 and Figure 10) indicate that, if the binding sites overlap, they do so only partially. Thus, the fact that WW781 binding is affected both by the orientation of the transport site (Ei versus Eo) and by the binding of Cl- suggests that an additional part of the AE1 protein, probably adjacent to but distinct from the disulfonic stilbene binding site, is affected by the conformational changes that occur during substrate binding and transport-site reorientation. This in turn implies that these conformational changes are not simply local reorientations of a few amino acids, but likely involve more global changes in protein structure such as have been observed with other proteins such as hemoglobin and alcohol dehydrogenase.

 In this study we have presented new evidence that a close interaction occurs between Tiam1 and certain plasma membrane proteins such as CD44v3 isoform. Using two recombinant proteins (CBP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex domain (Fig. 4, lane 1) and FLAG-tagged CD44 cytoplasmic domain (FLAG-CD44cyt) (Fig. 4, lane 2)), we have demonstrated that the PHn-CC-Ex domain of Tiam1 is directly involved in the binding to the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 (Figs. 5 and 6). In fact, the binding affinity of the PHn-CC-Ex domain of Tiam1 to CD44 is comparable with the intact Tiam1 binding to CD44 (Figs. 5 and 6). In the presence of PHn-CC-Ex, the binding between Tiam1 and CD44 (e.g. CD44v3) is greatly reduced (Fig. 6). The ability of PHn-CC-Ex to effectively compete for Tiam1 binding to the plasma membrane proteins such as CD44v3 (Fig. 6) strongly suggests that the PHn-CC-Ex of Tiam1 is responsible for the recognition of CD44 in vitro.

 SCL belongs to the basic domain helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 family of proteins (13). Three principal classes of bHLH proteins have been identified (14). Class A bHLH proteins include the E proteins E2A/ITF1 (immunoglobulin transcription factor 1), E2-2/ITF2, and HEB (an E protein related to E2A/ITF1 and E2-2/ITF2); these proteins are expressed ubiquitously. In contrast, the expression of class B bHLH proteins, such as MyoD and SCL, is restricted to specific organs or tissues. The myogenic (MyoD, myogenin, myf5) bHLH proteins have been studied extensively (15) and serve as a useful paradigm for the actions of tissue-restricted bHLH proteins. MyoD forms a heterodimer with the ubiquitously expressed E2A proteins (16), binds specific DNA sequence at the regulatory regions of genes coding for muscle-specific proteins (such as muscle creatine kinase), and activates transcription of these genes (17). Although unproven, it is thought that SCL activates transcription of genes required for normal hematopoietic development in an analogous fashion (18).

 peptidases &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; The Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that is widespread in the environment, where it survives hostile conditions, presumably due to the adaptation of various regulatory mechanisms. L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women and neonates. Its virulence is due to a capacity to invade and multiply within a wide variety of mammalian cells, including macrophages, hepatocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells (Vazquez-Boland et al., 2001). The molecular mechanisms of this intracellular parasitism have been investigated extensively, and these studies have revealed the crucial role of several secreted proteins, such as listeriolysin O (LLO) and phospholipases, and of surface-exposed proteins, such as internalin A (InlA) and InlB, in the virulence of this pathogen (Cossart, 2004; Dussurget et al., 2004). To date, most of the proteins shown to be directly involved in the virulence of L. monocytogenes are either secreted or cell-wall associated.

 Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 is mediated primarily by integrins (Hynes 1992 ), which together with soluble factors, control gene expression, differentiation, proliferation, and morphological changes (Clark and Brugge 1995 ; Schwartz et al. 1995 ; Dedhar and Hannigan 1996 ; Sastry and Horwitz 1996 ). Focal adhesions (FAs) are integrin-rich cell adhesion sites through which the ECM is physically linked to the actin cytoskeleton and signals are transduced into the intracellular compartment (for review see Jockusch et al. 1995 ; Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka 1996 ; Calderwood et al. 2000 ). A selective group of cytoplasmic proteins, which include catalytic proteins such as FA kinase (FAK) and noncatalytic proteins such as -actinin, talin, and paxillin are recruited to FAs in response to cell adhesion (Parsons et al. 1994 ; Ilic et al. 1997 ; Turner 1998 ). Consistent with the fundamental roles of cell matrix adhesions in control of cell behavior, many components of the FAs are well conserved in different organisms ranging from nematodes and insects to vertebrates (Hynes and Zhao 2000 ).

. &nbsp; In contrast to the situation with TLR3, we found that TLR7 is localized to intracellular membranes by its transmembrane domain. Truncations of the TLR4/TLR7 chimera removing almost the entire intracellular domain were still retained intracellularly, and moreover, the TLR7 transmembrane domain was able to target another type I transmembrane protein CD25 to an intracellular compartment, where the targeted CD25 strongly co-localized with TLR7. It has been suggested that some type II transmembrane proteins, such as -galactoside 2,6-sialyltransferase (23) and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (24), are targeted to an intracellular compartment, such as the Golgi apparatus, by 17-25-amino acid sequences of their transmembrane domains by unknown mechanisms. It has also been reported that, in yeast, type II or type III transmembrane proteins, such as Sec12p or Sec71p, are retained in the ER by a Golgi protein, Rer1p (25, 26). Sec12p and Sec71p contain a signal sequence for this targeting in their transmembrane domain. The polar amino acids in this targeting seem to be critical for recognition by Rer1p (26). Rer1p is a Golgi protein and is well conserved from yeast to mammals (27). It physically interacts with the transmembrane domain of Sec12p and promotes the retrieval of Sec12p from the Golgi to the ER (25, 28). Thus, Rer1p works as a retrieval receptor recognizing the transmembrane domain of ER proteins in the Golgi. We found that Region 2 (Ser844-Val850) of the transmembrane domain of TLR7 is the most important region for targeting TLR7 to an intracellular compartment. This region also contains four serine residues. One or more of these serine residues might be recognized by a Golgi protein, such as Rer1p. Molecular mechanisms of how signal sequences in transmembrane domains are recognized in the lipid bilayer, however, are still largely unknown, and further biochemical characterization is needed.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Sam68 was initially identified as a 68 kDa Src-associated protein in mitosis (1,2), and belongs to a family of proteins that contain KH domains. The KH domain is highly conserved in several RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNP-K (3), glycine-rich protein 33 (4), fragile X mental retardation gene FMR-1 (5) and the Caenorhabditis elegans germ-line-specific tumor suppressor GLD-1 (6), and as recently reported, other proteins such as SLM-1 (Sam68-like mammalian), SLM-2 (7), and the quaking proteins QKI-5, QKI-6 and QKI-7 (8,9). Some KH proteins are translational regulators (10), while others are thought to mediate alternative splicing (11,12). Using the random homozygous knockout antisense strategy, Sam68 has been implicated in cell proliferation and tumorogenesis (13). However, the exact cellular functions of Sam68 still remain to be established. It has been postulated to play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

 Nuclear localization of a kinase is necessary for phosphorylation of nuclear proteins such as transcription factors, although there are examples of transcription factors that are activated in the cytoplasm and then translocate to the nucleus (5, 6). The ability of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to be released from cytoplasmic tethering and then passively diffuse into the nucleus, where it can phosphorylate nuclear proteins such as cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, has been described (7). More recently, active export of protein kinase A out of the nucleus under certain conditions based on a nuclear export signal has also been reported (8). Regulation of protein kinase C localization appears to occur, at least in part, through isoform-specific targeting to anchoring proteins that are presumably located near its substrates (9). CaM kinase I has been localized predominantly to the cell cytoplasm, while CaM kinase IV is predominantly nuclear (10, 11), although the mechanisms governing the subcellular localization of these two kinases have not yet been elucidated.

 Unlike BBS6, the amino-acid sequence of BBS2 offers no functional insights. Other than a strong conservation across phyla, implying limited tolerance to variation, the primary sequence of BBS2 bears no homology to any known protein, nor does it contain any recognizable motifs (42). Computational modeling of the three-dimensional configuration of BBS2 does predict the presence of a coiled-coil domain near the N-terminus of the protein (unpublished data). This may indicate that BBS2 polymerizes with itself or other proteins (for a recent review of coiled-coil domains see 46). The diverse function of this domain, however, does not provide other functional clues. Coiled-coils have been found in a wide variety of proteins, ranging from cytoskeletal proteins such as -keratin (47) and molecular motor proteins such as myosin (48), to pH-dependent switches such as the macrophage scavenger receptor (49) and transcription factors such as the GCN4 leucine zipper (50). Further experiments will be required to establish the physiological role of BBS2 in the cell.

 PDZ domains have been shown to be involved in multiprotein complexes often linking plasma membrane proteins to stable subcellular structures (11, 12). In contrast, PMCA in the platelet only becomes associated with the cytoskeleton after activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement. The mechanism for this behavior could be similar to that described for neuronal F-actin binding proteins such as neurabin-I and -II (26). These PDZ domain-containing F-actin binding proteins become associated with polymerized actin, but dissociate upon depolymerization of the cytoskeleton. Thus, PMCA could associate with the cytoskeleton in activated platelets by interacting with a PDZ domain containing F-actin binding protein that binds to the reorganized cytoskeleton after activation. Although neurabins have not been reported in platelets, a protein with similar properties, CLP-36, has been described recently (27). This PDZ domain-containing protein binds to -actinin in the cytoskeleton of activated platelets by means of a distinct intervening sequence thus leaving the PDZ domain available for interaction with PDZ domain-binding proteins such as PMCA.

 Protein N-myristoylation in intact cells is not a single enzymatic reaction catalyzed by NMT. This modification appears to be a highly regulated reaction involving the coordinated participation of the protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) and several different enzymes/proteins such as N-methionylaminopeptidase, fatty acid synthase, long chain acyl-CoA synthetase, acyl-CoA-binding proteins, etc. Therefore, the substrate specificity of NMT analyzed by using purified NMT and synthetic peptide substrates may not fully reflect the substrate specificity of NMT in intact cells. In addition, other cotranslational protein modification such as protein N-acetylation might also affect the reaction. It has been estimated that as many as 70% of soluble proteins (cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic) in eukaryotes bear this modification (16). In fact, several proteins having an N-terminal Gly residue, such as ovalbumin (17), cytochrome c (18), and actin (19), were found to be N-acetylated. However, the difference in the N-terminal sequence requirement for protein N-myristoylation and protein N-acetylation has not been characterized so far.

 secretion.In contrast to Rab3A, Rab3B is capable of functioning as a positive regulator of secretion when stably expressed in PC12 cells. It seems highly unlikely that the stimulatory effect of Rab3B on regulated secretion by PC12 cells is due to some nonspecific effect on the availability of accessory proteins such as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor and guanine nucleotide exchange factor for other Rabs, in particular Rab3A. The activities of such accessory proteins are not typically limiting under conditions of moderate Rab overexpression(16, 41) . Moreover, we noted no effect of Rab3B expression on the membrane targeting of endogenous Rab3A, which might otherwise be expected if Rab3B were competing with Rab3A for accessory proteins such as guanine nucleotide dissociation factor and guanine nucleotide exchange factor. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that long-term Rab3B expression leads to secondary alterations in the secretory phenotypes of PC12 neuroendocrine cells that might not to be evident in transient transfection experiments (e.g. changes in rabphilin stability, see

 signals.Interferons seem to exert their inhibition on cell growth by acting at many different levels, (1) directly affecting the function of protein such as c-myc and Rb that are intimately involved in cell-cycle control, (2) increasing the level of enzymes such as the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase and the 2-5A synthetases that inhibit cell anabolism, and (3) inducing cell surface proteins such as 9-27/Leu-13 that relay other growth inhibitory signals. While the activation of a single pathway might be sufficient to inhibit the growth of a given cell, activation of multiple pathways by IFNs allows for both more efficiency and flexibility in the control of cell growth. Indeed, in a physiological setting, IFNs are acting on a population of cells at distinct stages and in different programs of differentiation, cells that are continuously exposed to various other stimuli and have to maintain the ability to perform other essential functions, hence the requirement for efficiency and flexibility, i.e. multiple

 The bHLH proteins have a conserved helix-loop-helix domain essential for dimerization of different bHLH proteins as well as a basic domain that mediates DNA binding to a common hexanucleotide sequence (CANNTG) known as the E-box. An inhibitory class of HLH proteins (Id) lacks the basic region and prevents DNA binding after dimerization with a bHLH protein (31, 32). Therefore, Id negatively regulates bHLH proteins by preventing them from binding to DNA. The bHLH proteins generally form heterodimers between ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins, such as E12 or E47, and cell-specific bHLH proteins, such as MyoD for muscle development or NeuroD for neural development. The bHLH heterodimer formed will then bind to an E-box response element and promote cell- or tissue-specific gene expression. Often factors that influence cell proliferation will influence bHLH expression (33, 34). The results presented here suggest that hormones and a paracrine factor produced by peritubular cells may influence Sertoli cell differentiated function (e.g. Tf expression) through bHLH-type transcription factors.

 The 5'- and 3'-ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs are protected from exonuclease degradation by the binding of eIF4E and poly(A) binding proteins (PABP) to the 7-methyl-guanosine cap and the poly(A) tail, respectively. The two ends are then linked together by eIF4G that acts as a bridging protein by binding to eIF4E and PABP (13, 14). Deadenylation is the initial step in the degradation of most mRNAs (4, 31). In yeast, deadenylation is usually followed by decapping and 5' 3' exonucleolytic degradation. However, in mammals the prominent pathway involves initial deadenylation followed by 3' 5' degradation. Various AREs, including the canonical AUUUA sequence (4), function as instability elements by binding proteins, such as TTP (2), that recruit the 3' 5' poly(A)-specific deadenylase DAN/PARN (13) and a complex of 3' 5' exoribonucleases that has been termed the exosome (30). The deadenylation and subsequent degradation of an mRNA can be averted by the alternative recruitment of a stabilizing ARE-binding protein such as HuR (5).

 Integrin adhesive capacity is regulated by complex intracellular signal transduction pathways, conformational changes, and clustering and lateral associations with other cell surface proteins and cytoskeletal elements.1 On most circulating leukocytes, 4 integrins have a low-binding affinity for VCAM-1.2 Inside-out signaling pathways activated by chemokines at a site of inflammation rapidly increase 4 integrin affinity and promote leukocyte emigration from blood into tissues.3,4 Alterations in integrin affinity are a consequence of conformational changes in the integrin extracellular and cytoplasmic domains and are regulated by associations with cytoplasmic proteins such as talin.5,6 The 4 integrins can also initiate outside-in signals and regulate cell spreading, migration, survival, and hematopoiesis.2,7-10 Integrin cytoplasmic domains have no enzymatic functions and activation of signaling cascades requires interactions with cytoplasmic signaling proteins and signaling adaptors. The chain of integrins, including 41, associates with a variety of cytoskeletal and adaptor proteins such as talin, filamin, and actinin.11 The cytoplasmic domain of the 4 integrin is unique because it specifically binds paxillin when Ser988 is dephosphorylated.12,13 Paxillin is a 68-kDa signaling adaptor molecule that contains LIM protein-protein interaction motifs and LD motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions.14,15 Paxillin interactions with 41 integrin may influence signaling through a variety of signaling pathways. Paxillin binds to tyrosine kinases including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2), Src and Abl, SH2-domain containing proteins such as Crk and PTPPEST, and p95PKL, which can interact with PIX (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and PAK (a serine, threonine-kinase). Through these interactions and associations with actin-binding proteins talin, vinculin, and actopaxin, 4 integrin-paxillin complexes are likely to play an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling and signaling events that are necessary for cell migration, activation, and development.

 GnRH acts on gonadotropin gene expression through the GnRH-R, a G protein-coupled receptor that activates several signal transduction pathways (9, 10). This receptor activates L-type calcium channels, causing an influx of extracellular calcium (11, 12), and also activates phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves phosphatidylinositoldiphosphate located in the cell membrane into inositol triphosphate, which mediates the calcium release from intracellular stores, and produces diacylglycerol (DAG) (13). Increased concentrations of intracellular calcium together with DAG, lead to activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which, in turn, activates other proteins by phosphorylation. This generally results in activation of downstream protein kinases such as those of the MAPK pathway (13, 14). The increase in calcium concentration in the cytoplasm can also activate other protein kinases such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (15, 16) independently of PKC or other members of the MAPK family. In addition, there are examples in other G protein-coupled receptor signaling systems in which nuclear calcium may change gene expression independently from cytoplasmic calcium (17, 18).

 control. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES &nbsp; Infection, inflammation, and trauma induce a wide range of metabolic changes in the liver as part of the APR and result in alterations in the concentrations of plasma proteins that are collectively called acute-phase proteins (4, 32). During the APR, the serum levels of proteins such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (SAA) increase (positive acute-phase proteins), whereas the serum levels of proteins such as albumin and transferrin decrease (negative acute-phase proteins) (4, 32, 39). LPS induces the APR by stimulating the release of cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 from macrophages and other cells (1, 2), which then mediate the biological action of LPS (17, 19, 28). Low doses of LPS induce release of TNF and IL-1 (1), and a dose of as little as 1 ng/mouse can cause the APR, as indicated by the induction of SAA (Kim MS, Moser A, Grunfeld C, and Feingold K, unpublished data).

 Caspase-3 activity is detected in cell lysates as early as 5&#160;h p.i. with PAK. In vivo expression of the type III secretion system is induced and ExoS synthesis is induced only after bacteria&#150;host cell contact. Thus, the interval during which the host cell becomes committed to apoptosis as a result of ExoS function is probably significantly shorter than the 5&#160;h seen here. This rapidity suggests that ExoS may be acting directly to activate apoptotic pathways in the cell. In vitro, ExoS ADP-ribosylates several host proteins, including intracellular proteins such as the intermediate filament protein vimentin (Coburn et al., 1989a ), several low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins (Coburn et al., 1989b ) and extracellular proteins such as human immunoglobulin 3 and apolipoprotein A1 (Knight &amp; Barbieri, 1997 ). In vivo, ExoS has been shown to specifically ADP-ribosylate Ras proteins, uncoupling Ras-mediated signal-transduction pathways (Vincent et al., 1999 , McGuffie et al., 1998 ; Ganesan et al., 1998 , 1999 ). Among the four Ras proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-RasA and K-RasB), H-Ras was found to be ADP-ribosylated most extensively. Ras is a molecular switch which controls cellular processes in response to extracellular stimuli. GTP-bound forms of Ras can activate downstream effectors (including Raf-1) which initiate MAP kinase pathways that regulate gene expression affecting cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Of interest are also the GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), such as Ras-GAP, which accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras resulting in inactive GDP-bound forms of Ras (McNeill &amp; Downward, 1999 ). Thus, activation of MAP kinase pathways through ADP-ribosylation of Ras is an attractive mechanistic model for the ExoS-mediated apoptosis. However, the exact pathway(s) by which ExoS triggers apoptosis remains to be elucidated and may involve other yet-to-be-identified cellular targets of the ExoS ADP-ribosyltransferase.

 A third question posed by this assay concerns the multiple cellular functions involved in the appearance of a metaphase chromatid break. Specifically, breaks and other damage formed by ionizing radiation are detected by proteins, such as the ATM gene product and DNA-dependent protein kinase. Once sensed, the cellular response is signaled by proteins, such as Chk2, p53, and others, usually resulting in cell cycle arrest. The detection and response functions should determine not only the number of breaks seen in metaphase cells but also the number of cells in metaphase. An arrested cell should not appear in a metaphase spread, suggesting that at least some of the breaks being scored in this assay are in cells with altered detection or response functions. It will be very interesting to know how often a chromatid break appears in this assay as a result of a defect in a DNA repair enzyme versus a defect in a sensing, signaling, or response protein. Is this assay really a measure of altered response rather than repair?

 Adaptor proteins, such as Nck1, Grb2, and CrkII, consist primarily of a single Src homology (SH)2 domain and various numbers of SH3 domains and do not have other functional motifs (11, 12). The SH2 domain recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and the SH3 domain associates with the PXXP motif-containing proteins (13). These domains provide a site in which coupling of the distinct molecules to the core machinery regulates the cellular function and gives specificity to the signal transduction. Among them, Grb2 provides a well characterized example of how adaptor proteins of this group function to transduce signals. Grb2 constantly associates with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sos of Ras GTPases via the SH3 domains (14). Following growth factor stimulation, Grb2 binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor kinases and/or other adaptor proteins such as Shc via its SH2 domain. As a result, Sos is translocated to the plasma membranes, leading to Ras-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (15, 16).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; It is well recognized that a variety of lipid second messengers in low abundance carry out specific tasks for a wide range of biological processes in eukaryotic cells. The cellular concentrations of such signaling lipids must be strictly regulated by the action of metabolic enzymes. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK)1 phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DAG) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) (1). DAG is an established activator of conventional and novel protein kinases C (PKCs), Unc-13, and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (2&#150;6). PA has also been reported to regulate a number of signaling proteins such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, Raf-1 kinase, atypical PKC, and chimaerins (6&#150;8). Moreover, specific PA-binding sites have recently been identified in several important proteins such as Raf-1 (9), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (10), and p47phox (11). Thus, DGK can potentially participate in a diverse range of cellular events through modulating the balance between two bioactive lipids, DAG and PA.

 The effect of vasopressin is the result of stimulating cAMP, because the effect of vasopressin can be mimicked by a membrane-permeable cAMP analog (3). It is well established that PKA-induced phosphorylation has an important role in regulating the activity of the SK channels. It was reported that mutating one PKA phosphorylation site significantly diminished the K current in oocytes injected with ROMK1 (13, 14, 23). A large body of evidence has indicated that the specificity of PKA may partially be determined by the A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), which binds the regulatory subunit of PKA and brings PKA to the close vicinity of effector proteins such as ion channels (2, 5, 17). Our laboratory has previously shown that AKAP is involved in mediating the effect of PKA on ROMK1 (1, 2). Because AKAP is associated with a membrane by the cytoskeleton, it is possible that the lack of vasopressin's effect in CCDs treated with cytochalasin D may result from disrupting the membrane targeting of the associate proteins such as AKAP.

 We identified myne-1 by its homology to the SRs of kakapo. SRs are normally associated with a number of cytoskeletal proteins, such as spectrin, dystrophin, utrophin, -actinin, plectin and ACF7, and participate in protein-protein interactions with other cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and zyxin (Amann et al., 1998; Crawford et al., 1992; Rybakova et al., 1996; Rybakova and Ervasti, 1997). Because SR proteins are generally associated with the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, the nuclear membrane localization of myne-1 is unusual. mAKAP, a protein kinase A anchoring protein targeted to the nuclear membrane of differentiated myocytes, possesses three SRs, two of which are critical for targeting mAKAP to the nuclear membrane (Kapiloff et al., 1999). Downstream regulation of cAMP-dependent proteins such as protein kinase A (PKA) is mediated by anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that sequester PKA to discrete subcellular locations. This compartmentalization is critical for cellular function, as specificity of cAMP-mediated signaling and function is based in a large part on distinct spatial positioning. In the case of mAKAP, it is the SRs of the protein that are critical for the compartmentalization of the protein, targeting mAKAP to the nuclear membrane (Kapiloff et al., 1999). Like mAKAP, myne-1 may serve as a scaffolding protein for kinases. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, Apel et al., demonstrated that syne-1 binds to MuSK, a tyrosine kinase expressed in postsynaptic myocytes (Apel et al., 2000). The in vitro interaction between syne-1 and MuSK occurs in the cytoplasmic domain of MuSK. This cytoplasmic domain contains the tyrosine kinase domain of MuSK (Valenzuela et al., 1995) and demonstrates high homology to many tyrosine kinases when subjected to a BLAST search. Thus, syne-1/myne-1 may act as a scaffold for any number of tyrosine kinases, or serine/threonine kinases, as its serine-rich C-terminal domain implies.

 We used proteomic analysis to study changes in the relative abundance of a large number of urinary proteins simultaneously. Using 2D analysis software, protein expression could be compared based on the intensity of staining, which represented the amount of protein per spot. Acute sodium loading caused changes in urinary excretion of 45&nbsp;protein components. Some of the altered proteins have never been studied in relationship to salt loading, and their roles in sodium regulation have not been established. Several proteins, such as NEP 24.11&nbsp;(enkephalinase or neprilysin), solute carrier family 3,&nbsp;meprin 1, and ezrin (villin-2), are typical membrane proteins. Some proteins, such as vacuolar H+-ATPase, dnaK-type chaperone (heat shock protein 72), albumin precursor, and chloride intracellular channel protein 1,&nbsp;were identified in rat kidney cortex and medulla in our previous study (3). Cells, debris, and particles were completely removed from the samples, as determined by a hemacytometric counting chamber. Thus most of these proteins probably originate in the renal tubules and may play important roles in sodium regulation.

 Further evidence that the physiological role of MED1 may lie outside mismatch correction comes from the observation that the alterations of the MED1 gene in primary tumors are frameshift mutations that target two coding polyadenine tracts, likely as a result of a generalized microsatellite instability (30,31). The tumors were all defective in either MSH2 or MLH1, based on an immunohistochemistry survey, and MED1 mutations appeared more commonly in tumors of later clinical stages (30,31). These data support the contention that MED1 mutations arose late in tumor progression as a result of the mutator phenotype conferred by the loss of a critical MR protein, such as MSH2 or MLH1. If a required enzymatic contribution of MED1 were strand discrimination for human MR, its contribution to mutagenesis would be predicted to be epistatic with respect to essential MR proteins such as MSH2 or MLH1. Taken together, these data are consistent with a role for MED1 independent of methyl-directed MR, as our data indicate, but still do not provide a conclusive exclusion from MR.

 In contrast, expression of other heterologous membrane proteins such as SGLT1 (Zampighi et al., 1995; Hirsch et al., 1996) and aquaporin-0 (Chandy et al., 1997) increased the area of the plasma membrane of oocytes up to fourfold. In the case of SGLT1, the increase in the plasma membrane area occurs concurrently with an increase in the number of transporters in the plasma membrane, and the rate of SGLT1 insertion is comparable to that observed here (Hirsch et al., 1996; Wright et al., 1997). Therefore, it appears that the delivery of some endogenous membrane proteins, as well as heterologous proteins such as SGLT1 and Cx50, to the plasma membrane involves the same mechanism. The difference in the trafficking of the heterologous membrane proteins appears to involve the retrieval mechanism. In the case of Cx50, endocytosis of large Cx50-containing vesicles balances the rate of small vesicle insertion. In oocytes expressing SGLT1, however, this pathway does not balance the rate of vesicle exocytosis, resulting in a continuous increase in the area of the plasma membrane.

 Calcyclin is a 10.5-kDa protein that belongs to the family of calcium-binding proteins (28-31). Calcium-binding proteins are divided into two groups: the first group is constituted by annexins, and the second group by EF-hand proteins such as calmodulin. Calcyclin belongs to this second group. It was first identified as a cell cycle-dependent protein highly induced by growth conditions (28), but its precise role remains unknown. Different studies have shown that calcyclin is expressed only in fibroblasts and epithelial cells and that it can associate with other proteins, in particular annexins (annexin-2, -6,&nbsp;and -11) (32, 33). Calcyclin, as annexins, may be involved in exocytosis phenomena. In this way, it has been shown in numerous studies that modulation of intracellular calcium plays an important role in the regulation of exocytosis and that calcium-binding proteins can act as transducing proteins in coupling stimulus to exocytosis. It has also been shown that, in vitro, calcyclin can bind actin-binding proteins such as caldesmon, tropomyosin, and calponin (34-36).

 The receptor-mediated nuclear transport of proteins depends on topogenic signals in the primary sequence of karyophilic proteins. The first NLS identified in karyophilic proteins were short sequence motifs in the large T-antigen of SV40 virus (11) and in nucleoplasmin, an acidic protein involved in chromatin assembly. Both signals consist of clusters of basic amino acids. The NLS in the SV40 large T-antigen consists of a heptapeptide containing 5&nbsp;basic amino acids, whereas the nucleoplasmin NLS is bipartite and contains two short clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer of ~10 other amino acids (12). These two NLS are referred to as classical nuclear localization signals (NLS).1 In the meantime, other primary structure motifs have been described that facilitate the nuclear transport of proteins, such as the M9 sequence in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (13), and nuclear targeting signals of ribosomal proteins, such as L23a (14) and L5 (15, 16). In general, these nonclassical nuclear targeting signals are longer than the two classical NLS motifs (for review see Ref. 17).

 The primary reaction of isothiocyanates at physiological pH is with thiols (16,22). Post-translational modification of protein thiols is recognized as a cell signaling mechanism that may regulate sensitivity to apoptosis. A variety of proteins, including transcription factors, membrane channels, cysteine-dependent proteases, phosphatases and kinases, or proteins that bind and regulate the activity of these cellular constituents, have cysteine residues that can switch between reduced and oxidized forms (46&#150;48). This causes active site or conformational modifications, thereby altering catalytic activity or protein&#150;protein interactions. Transient thiol oxidation is proposed to be a routine and fundamental event during the initiation of apoptosis. Redox-sensitive targets include a thiol protein involved in opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (49) and proteins such as thioredoxin and glutaredoxin bound to the apoptosis-signaling kinase ASK-1 (48). Alternatively, apoptosis could progress without the need for thiol oxidation, but oxidation of redox-sensitive signaling proteins, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, or transcription factors could promote a pro-apoptotic environment in cells that are normally resistant.

 Unfortunately, no specific PKB inhibitors or cell lines that lack expression of all PKB isoforms have been developed. Without such tools we cannot rule out the possibility that the phosphorylation of even a potential PKB substrate protein, such as GSK3 or forkhead, is in fact not mediated by PKB but rather by another PI-3-kinase-activated protein kinase, such as SGK. Although dominant negative forms of PKB have been used extensively to dissect the signalling networks that are regulated by PKB, great caution must also be employed when one uses these reagents, because the mechanism by which a dominant negative PKB mutant is functioning in cells is not known. For example, dominant negative PKB might work by interacting with and inhibiting PDK1, which could affect the phosphorylation of other AGC kinases that it activates, such as SGK. Additionally, dominant negative PKB could also interact non-physiologically with a substrate of another PI-3-kinase-activated protein kinase when overexpressed in cells, and this could prevent this substrate from becoming phosphorylated by its natural upstream kinase.

 Recent studies in smooth muscle cells (16&#150;22) revealed that the ability of IGF-I to initiate its intracellular signals is regulated not only by its binding to its own transmembrane receptor (IGF-IR) but also by other transmembrane proteins, such as SHPS-1 and v3 integrin, to recruit essential signaling proteins, such as SHP-2 and Shc. The integrin recruitment of SHP-2 is essential for regulation of the overall IGF-IR phosphorylation level (18) and the propagation of downstream signaling events (19). Accordingly, ligand occupancy of v3 integrin results in phosphorylation of the 3 integrin subunit, which leads to Downstream of tyrosine kinase I (DOKI)-mediated recruitment of SHP-2 (20). Blocking ligand occupancy of v3 integrin inhibited IGF-I-dependent downstream signaling events, membrane recruitment of SHP-2, and cell migration and proliferation (21, 22). Expression of a dominant negative mutant of the 3 integrin subunit in smooth muscle cells completely abolished the mitogenic activity of IGF-I (16). Thus, integrin activation may have a permissive action in the IGF-IR signaling pathway.

 As a consequence of these conformational transitions of KLH1 molecules, a strong influence on surface located epitopes is thought to be involved, which may result in differences in the immunological properties of this molecule extensively used in biology and therapeutic medicine. A strong influence of small changes on the surface of proteins such as conformational switches on the effectiveness of epitopes is indeed well documented for other proteins such as myoglobins (36, 37). However, this was never investigated or even considered for KLH, which is commonly used in biochemistry, physiology, immunology, and medicine. Based on our SAXS experiments, we postulate a similar effect for KLH1. It is easy to imagine that the structure and the accessibility of any epitopes on the surface may be different in the oxy and deoxy form of the KLH1 molecules when such massive changes in the surface structure are observed. Thus, our study strongly indicates that more information regarding the epitopes and their changes due to conformational transitions are needed to understand the immunological interaction of KLH1 at the molecular level.

 Our rheological measurements show that increasing concentrations of actin slightly slow down gelation kinetics. This results suggests that passive entropy-driven diffusion of filaments into the large pores of the meshwork or other passive effects such as annealing and breaking of filaments that may influence the rate of homogenization are too slow to sustain fast morphological changes of the cell. The homogenization of the actin cytoskeleton by passive filament diffusion could to be complemented by an activated process. This process could be initiated by motor proteins such as myosin, which would bias and enhance the transport of filaments into large meshwork pores (44). Large pores could also be "filled in" by localized polymerization of actin via nucleators such as the Arp2/3 complex and/or by the activation of F-actin severing/nucleating proteins such as gelsolin. Using the method of time-resolved multiple particle tracking introduced in this report, we are currently measuring the rate of gelation and ultrastructural homogenization of F-actin networks in the presence of myosin, the Arp2/3 complex, and gelsolin.

 Last, much recent work has suggested that serine phosphorylation of either the insulin receptor and/or IRS-1 may play an important role in mediating insulin resistance (63-65). In these papers tumor necrosis factor &nbsp;has been suggested to lead to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 resulting in a poorly understood decrease in the ability of the insulin receptor to phosphorylate IRS-1 upon tyrosines, thus leading to impaired insulin signaling. Our data, showing that proteins such as 14-3-3&nbsp;can interact with IRS-1 in an apparently phosphoserine-dependent manner provides a potential molecular mechanism by which serine phosphorylation might down-regulate IRS-1-mediated signaling. In this model, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 may lead to interaction with phosphoserine-binding proteins such as 14-3-3&nbsp;which may hinder signaling, perhaps by sterically blocking access of IRS-1 to the insulin receptor or by blocking access to downstream signaling proteins. Identification of the serine residues within IRS-1 which mediate this effect will be essential to understanding the molecular mechanisms of this response.

 The caspases, well conserved from nematodes to mammals, are processed to active (cleaved) forms in cells undergoing apoptosis and thus play a crucial role in the transduction of apoptotic signals in cells that are destined to die (13). Caspase activation occurs by self-proteolysis and/or results from the actions of other proteins (14). Ligation of Fas ligand to Fas in the cellular membrane and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the mitochondrial membrane trigger activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively (15). Once activated, these caspases transduce a signal to effector caspases, including caspases-3, -6, and -7 (15). This causes degradation of the cellular substrates of these caspases, including cytoplasmic structural proteins such as actin and cytokeratins and/or nuclear proteins such as poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamins (16, 17, 18, 19). Among the effector caspases, activated caspase-3 appears to induce activation of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD; also called DNA fragmentation factor-40 or caspase-activated nuclease), which is integrally involved in degrading DNA (20, 21, 22).

 In addition to PLC activation, S1P has recently been reported to influence effector systems, such as adenylyl cyclase (3, 26), K+ channel (26, 27), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (4), that are involved in the early signal transduction of cell surface receptor agonists. Similar stimulation of these effector systems has been reported by lysosphingolipids other than S1P, such as SPC and psychosine (16, 26, 28, 29, 30). As mentioned above, we found that S1P induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in addition to PLC activation in FRTL-5 cells. In this case, PTX almost completely suppressed the S1P-induced action. Thus, S1P stimulated at least two signaling pathways, leading to activation of PLC and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, probably through distinct G proteins in FRTL-5 thyroid cells, i.e. the former pathway may be mediated predominantly through PTX-insensitive G proteins such as Gq/G11, and the latter pathway through PTX-sensitive G proteins such as Gi/Go proteins. Gi/Go proteins may also be involved in the activation of PLC in an indirect or permissive manner.

 Integrin engagement and subsequent clustering of these receptors in focal adhesions leads to the generation of intracellular macromolecular complexes (Yamada and Miyamoto, 1995). Numerous proteins present at the cytoplasmic face of focal adhesions are considered to be structural components of focal adhesions, including cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin and talin (Jockusch and Rudiger, 1996). In addition, numerous "signaling" proteins with enzymatic activity (e.g., kinases and GTPases) are also components of focal adhesions. By clustering these structural and signaling components together, integrins transduce the signals required to mediate certain aspects of cell physiology and morphology (Clark and Brugge, 1995; Schwartz et al., 1995; Yamada and Geiger, 1997). These signals may include tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as paxillin and p130CAS (Burridge et al., 1992; Petch et al., 1995), activation of protein tyrosine kinases such as the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src (Schaller and Parsons, 1994; Kaplan et al., 1995), and activation of serine/threonine kinases such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) or Akt (Chen et al., 1994; Schlaepfer et al., 1994; King et al., 1997).

 In most cases, the rate-limiting step in activation of the ERK and JNK pathways is the conversion of small GTPases from the inactive GDP-bound state to their active GTP-bound form (8, 9). The GDP/GTP exchange is modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote formation of the GTP-bound form, and by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of G-proteins (8). Many GEFs for Ras and Rho-like GTPases identified in mammalian cells are bound to adaptor proteins, such as Grb2, Crk, or Nck (4, 8-10). These adaptor proteins are composed of a SH2 domain and of one or more SH3 domains (10). Upon cell stimulation, the SH2 domains of Grb2, Crk, and Nck bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins, such as Shc, IRS-1, Frs2, Gab-1, or p130Cas, or directly to protein receptor tyrosine kinases (4, 10). Thereby, the adaptor protein/GEF complex is translocated to the plasma membrane, where GEFs catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange and activate membrane-bound GTPases (4, 10).

 GRIPE Is a Novel Interacting Partner to E12, and May Regulate Its Dimerization State in the Nucleus-- The association of GRIPE to E12 was mapped to the HLH domain of E12, suggesting that GRIPE may share and compete with other HLH proteins for dimerization with E12. Furthermore, E12 may be important for the delivery of GRIPE to the nucleus, indicating that one facet of GRIPE function is dependent upon its dimerization to E12, and subsequent nuclear import of the dimer. The attenuation of E12-dependent target gene transcription by GRIPE suggests a function akin to inhibitory HLH proteins, such as ID2, that are known to negatively regulate HLH signaling cascades by forming inactive heterodimers with E12 (17). Furthermore, striking similarities between the HLH and adjacent C-terminal domains of E proteins, such as HEB and E2-2 (27), suggest that GRIPE may bind these as well, and influence multiple HLH signaling cascades involving these transcription factors. Taken together, these results indicate that GRIPE may be a transcriptional regulator in association with E12 but by itself has other cytoplasmic functions.

 proteome &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Albumin Depletion Complex biological samples such as serum contain thousands of proteins and peptides that are present in a large dynamic concentration range from the common highly abundant proteins (such as albumin) to the extremely low abundant proteins (such as the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1) (17). A major contributing factor to the analytical challenge of characterizing the serum proteome is that a single protein, albumin, comprises 50% of the protein content (Fig. 1; www.plasmaproteome.org). Indeed, only 10 proteins constitute 90% of the protein content of serum. Of the remaining 10%, 12 proteins make up 90% of this remaining total. In fact, only 1% of the entire protein content of serum is made up of proteins that are considered to be in low abundance and of great interest in proteomic studies in search of potential biomarkers. While the depletion of all 22 proteins considered to be highly abundant represents a difficult proposition, simply removing albumin would have a significant impact in the ability to characterize the serum proteome by MS.

 The role of the C-terminal motif in postendocytic sorting is similar to that of the PIST/PDZK1 binding motif in the CFTR, as lack of this motif leads to a defect in receptor recycling (35). Although for CFTR the additional interaction of the C terminus with the Na+exchanger regulatory factor PDZ domain may contribute to recycling to the plasma membrane (as has been observed also for the 2-adrenergic receptor, Ref. 39), we have no evidence for additional proteins (besides PDZK1 and PIST) binding to the SSTR5 C terminus, suggesting that the relative contributions of PIST and PDZK1 may determine the postendocytotic fate of the receptor. Interestingly, Gage et al. (40) have recently provided evidence that type I PDZ ligands are sufficient to promote rapid recycling of the 2-adrenergic receptor independent of their ability to bind to Na+/H+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor. As we could not detect endogenous PDZK1 in HEK cells (data not shown), we currently favor a model where the receptor is sorted to the Golgi compartment after internalization independently of its PDZ ligand motif. PIST recognizes the endocytosed receptor in the Golgi/TGN and directs its sorting back to the plasma membrane. Via its coiled-coil domain, PIST associates with syntaxin-6, a SNARE protein that is involved in trafficking between endosomes and the TGN and might therefore assist in the proper sorting of membrane proteins such as the SSTR5 (22, 41, 42). In this respect, PIST might be a general sorting molecule for a wide variety of transmembrane proteins ranging from GPCRs (SSTR5 and the 1-adrenergic receptor; Ref. 43) to cell adhesion molecules (44) to ion channels (chloride channel 3b) or their associated proteins such as stargazin (45). PDZK1 also recognizes multiple types of membrane proteins. This is in contrast to proteins such as GASP or the -arrestins, which so far appear to be specifically devoted to the postendocytic sorting of GPCRs only.

 THE microtubule network plays an important role in maintaining cellular morphology, in mitotic processes, in intracellular trafficking, and in establishing cellular polarity and neurite outgrowth in differentiating neurons (Drubin and Nelson, 1996; Li and Black, 1996; Goodson et al., 1997). Microtubules serve as tracks for the movement of mitochondria (Nangaku et al., 1994; Morris and Hollenbeck, 1995; Rickard and Kreis, 1996), lysosomes (Hollenbeck and Swanson, 1990), peroxisomes (Wiemer et al., 1997) and various other organelles such as endocytotic or exocytotic vesicles (Scales et al., 1997). Furthermore, they are important in establishing and maintaining the functionality of the endoplasmic reticulum (Waterman-Storer et al., 1995). Microtubule (MT)1-dependent transport is achieved through motor proteins such as dynein or kinesin and their relatives (Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997; Hirokawa, 1998; Lippincott-Schwartz, 1998). Kinesin is a plus-end-directed motor, whereas dynein-related motor proteins move in the opposite direction (Brady, 1995; Vallee and Sheetz, 1996). The organelles are linked to the motors via membrane/organelle-bound adaptor proteins such as kinectin or dynactin (Kumar et al., 1995; Burkhardt et al., 1997).

 Most of the transmembrane proteins have positively charged amino acid residues in their juxta-membrane regions, and these residues are thought to form an anchor, arresting translocation across the bilayer during biosynthesis and assuring the correct topological orientation of membrane proteins (Boyde and Beckwith, 1990). For example, there are several positively charged amino acid residues in the juxta-transmembrane domains of E-cadherin and occludin, which did not bind to ERM proteins. As shown in Table I, we found that the balance of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues in the whole cytoplasmic domain was significantly different between ERM-binding proteins such as CD44, CD43, and ICAM-2, and ERM-nonbinding proteins such as E-cadherin and occludin. The calculated isoelectric points of the whole cytoplasmic domains of CD44, CD43, ICAM-2, E-cadherin, and occludin were 8.17, 9.24,&nbsp;12.98,&nbsp;3.89,&nbsp;and 5.85,&nbsp;respectively, indicating that, at neutral pH, CD44, CD43, and ICAM-2 have a net positive charge over their whole cytoplasmic domain and that E-cadherin and occludin have a net negative charge.

 Recently, genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified at least six genes that are involved in clearance of apoptotic cells (1, 8). These six genes fall into two partially redundant complementation groups and include ced-1, ced-6, and ced-7 in one group and ced-2, ced-5, and ced-10 in another (9). The cloning of the ced-6 gene by Liu and Hengartner (10) showed that the ceCED-61 protein resembles an adapter protein with an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region with no apparent catalytic domain. The CED-6 PTB domain is highly homologous to the "classical" PTB domains originally identified in other mammalian signaling proteins such as Shc. PTB domains of proteins such as Shc, Numb, FE65, and X11 have been shown to mediate protein-protein as well as protein-phospholipid interactions (11-14). Because many PTB domain-containing proteins have been shown to function downstream of cell surface receptors, it was proposed that CED-6 may function as a signaling adapter protein during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (10).

).The secretion defect in cells that have been depleted for the SecE protein is much stronger than that observed in other conditional sec mutants. The magnitude of this defect is evidenced by two findings. First, CM124 cells depleted of SecE accumulate large amounts of precursor species of proteins such as DegP, which have been difficult to visualize previously (Fig.&nbsp;2). Second, precursors of proteins, such as OmpA, that accumulate under SecE depletion conditions are very slowly converted to the mature species during the course of a chase. This is in contrast to the fate of precursor OmpA accumulated in many other sec conditional mutants where a large proportion of this precursor species eventually becomes exported(13) . Conversely, there is no detectable secretion defect in the SecE depletion strains when grown under permissive conditions, in contrast to other secE conditional alleles (Fig.&nbsp;2; (13) ). The ability to both elicit a strong secretion defect in SecE-depleted cells and to assay MalF insertion in a sensitive manner led us to readdress whether MalF has a Sec requirement for its insertion into the cytoplasmic

PIP also binds to actin-regulating proteins such as profilin(10) , cofilin(11) , gelsolin(12) , gCap(13) , and -actinin (1) and regulates the functions of these proteins. When PIP binds to -actinin, which is an actin cross-linking protein, it further activates actin gelation by -actinin(1) . It is noteworthy that profilin plays crucial roles in tyrosine kinase-coupled PIP hydrolysis. Under resting conditions, PLC-1 causes little hydrolysis of profilin-bound PIP, but PLC-1 phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases overcomes the inhibitory effect by profilin and hydrolyzes bound PIP(14) . It has also been shown that the decrease in PIP bound to -actinin and vinculin by treatment with platelet-derived growth factor correlates with the depolymerization of actin(2) . All these data suggest that the amount of PIP in the actin-binding protein regulates the development of stress fibers when the cells are

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Human Toll-like receptors (TLRs)1 detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (1-7) and share with the IL-1 receptor a conserved cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R homology (TIR) domain (8). The engagement of these receptors allows for their TIR domains to recruit the adapter protein Myd88 (9) and other TIR domain containing adapter proteins such as MyD88 adapter-like/TIR domain-containing adapter protein (10, 11), TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-/TIR-containing adaptor molecule-1 (12, 13), and TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon--related adaptor molecule (14, 15). Some of these adaptor proteins, such as Myd88, subsequently recruit and activate members of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family (16-20). The IRAK-Myd88 association triggers hyperphosphorylation of IRAK leading to its dissociation from Myd88 and its interaction with the downstream adaptor tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) (21). This results in activation of transforming growth factor--activating kinase 1 (TAK-1) leading to stimulation of IB kinases and ultimately activation of NFB (22).

 In both models, the ability of Bcl-2 proteins to regulate the state and integrity of VDAC could thus account for their ability to be either anti- or pro-apoptotic. However, the mechanisms of VDAC channel regulation by Bcl-2 proteins proposed in these models are diametrically opposite. In the first model, the closure of VDAC channels leads to MOM rupture, and anti-apoptotic protein helps to maintain VDAC channels in their normal, functional open state. In the second model, the pro-apoptotic protein induces opening of the large VDAC-based channels permeable to cytochrome c. The mechanism of MOM permeabilization is undoubtedly very complex and most likely involves more than one protein to form the passages for cytochrome c release. Ceramides have also been proposed to form this permeability pathway (29). The role of VDAC in this process is rather controversial; but considering that both BH1-3 proteins such as Bax and BH3 domain-only proteins such as Bid are most likely required for MOM permeabilization, it is important to test the effect of both pro-apoptotic proteins on VDAC channels.

In particular, various cell lines of different origin, including immortalized fibroblasts, lung, mammary, larynx and colon cancer cells, were exposed to a combination of &#223;-carotene and tar (cigarette total particulate matter). Tar contains high concentrations of stable radicals; it is continually being deposited in the lungs of smokers and associates with DNA damage (19). Therefore, cells exposed to this mixture represent a suitable model to evaluate the detrimental effects of cigarette tar and the concomitant interactions with &#223;-carotene. After the exposure, several parameters were evaluated: (i) DNA oxidative damage measured as 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation; (ii) cell growth; (iii) cell cycle progression and cell cycle-related proteins, such as p53, p21, CD1 and Rb; (iv) apoptosis induction and apoptosis related proteins, such as Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL; (v) expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which has been recently proposed as a suitable marker of smoke-related carcinogenesis (25,26); and (vi) &#223;-carotene oxidation.

 Both metalloprotein-catalyzed and nonenzymatic nitration processes are sufficiently rapid and can certainly occur on the physiological time scale. How about the specificity of the process? Certainly, the enzymatically catalyzed nitration of proteins is expected to confer specificity, as either metalloproteins would catalyze their own nitration or the nitration of proteins within a short radius of their location. Proximity-facilitated selectivity has been demonstrated in a cellular model of myeloperoxidase transcytosis, where nitrated fibronectin has been spatially associated with myeloperoxidase (7). The advent of proteomic approaches, as well as the development of numerous immunological and analytical methodologies, has revealed that protein nitration is limited to specific proteins (6, 25, 84). Although the proximity to the generating system is responsible in part for this selectivity, the in vivo nitration of soluble and abundantly expressed proteins such as actin (3) and -synuclein (24) suggests the existence of additional biochemical and biophysical reasons for selective protein nitration. We have hypothesized that, analogous to other modifications of tyrosine residues in proteins such as phosphorylation and sulfation, nitration may also follow similar sequence and structural requirements (43).

 In view of the promiscuous interactions of eNOS with various cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins such as Ca2+-calmodulin, Hsp-90, protein kinase B/Akt, and caveolin-1 that influence its activity as well as its subcellular localization but also serve a wide array of interactions far beyond eNOS binding (Pratt 1997; Lawlor and Alessi 2001; Razani et al. 2002), one may expect that a widely expressed protein such as NOSIP has eNOS-independent functions, e.g., in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle cells lacking demonstrable eNOS. One possibility is that NOSIP is functionally linked to nNOS, as is the case in neuronal cells of the dorsal spinal horn, where NOSIP appears to modulate NO homeostasis in pathological pain conditions (Dreyer et al. 2003). Alternatively, NOSIP may interact with yet unknown partner proteins; our present experimental efforts are directed toward the identification of non-NOS proteins targeted by NOSIP. Finally, one should consider the possibility that NOSIP may function in smooth muscle cells of smaller vessels under conditions that induce the expression of eNOS, for example, under hyperoxic conditions (Steudel et al. 1999).

In contrast, only ICAM-5 has been shown to have a restricted expression to soma-dendritic membranes of telencephalic neurons (Yoshihara et al. 1994 ; Benson et al. 1998 ). The immunofluorescence studies show that ICAM-5 had a similar distribution as the dendritic marker MAP-2. MAP-2 evidently also stained some axons (Fig 7 b), probably due to the fact that the neurons at this stage are not absolutely polarized. In contrast, axon staining with antitau showed a different distribution and little overlap was seen in cells grown on ICAM-5. When coated on laminin, a number of tau+ neurites were seen. The stainings indicate that ICAM-5 promotes the expression of dendritic proteins, such as MAP-2, much better than laminin, whereas laminin promotes the expression of axonal proteins such as tau.

 In addition to the CSD, WCSP1 contains three C-terminal CCHC-type zinc fingers, which are interspersed by glycine-rich domains. This RNA-binding motif was identified previously in retroviral nucleocapsid proteins (33), TFIIIA (48), and more recently in plant proteins such as AtGRP2 of Arabidopsis (49), GRP2 (49), and RZ-1 (50) of N.&nbsp;sylvestris and AG5 of wheat (51). The CCHC motif has been described previously to bind solely RNA (48); however, deletion of three CCHC motifs and flexible glycine-rich linker regions in WCSP1 nearly eliminated binding to dsDNA (Fig. 7C). The glycine-rich domain is also found in many plant RNA-binding proteins (52). In contrast to other RNA-binding motifs, this domain does not contain fixed consensus sequences. Although it is not known whether the glycine-rich domain is directly involved in RNA binding, deletion of this domain resulted in a loss of poly(G)RNA binding activity in RZ-1 (50). The glycine-rich domain may be a variant of the well defined RGG-box found in RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNP U1 (53) and nucleolin (54).

 In addition to the regulation of ERK and JNK activation, Pyk2 has also been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility (12, 13). Several focal adhesion associated-proteins such as paxillin, p130Cas, and its homologue HEF1 (human enhancer of filamentation 1) have recently been shown associated constitutively with Pyk2 (12, 13, 51). It has been reported that Ang II and other stimuli cause tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion associated-proteins (52-54). Given the constitutive association of SHP-2 with Pyk2, SHP-2 may regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, p130Cas, and HEF1 within the complexes, thus modulating the cell motility. Yu et al. (55) recently reported that SHP-2 plays an important role in cell spreading, migration, and focal adhesion. Additional cellular proteins, such as Graf (the GTPase-activating protein for Rho), Nirs (amino-terminal domain-interacting receptors), and Pap proteins, were also shown to be constitutively associated with the Pyk2/SHP-2 complex and participate in broad range of signaling pathways in cells (56-59). Whether they are directly or indirectly regulated by SHP-2 remains to be investigated.

 The precise tyrosine kinase targets that regulate endothelial cell permeability are not known; however, an increase in endothelial cell contraction or a decrease in endothelial cell tethering, either to adjacent cells or to the extracellular matrix, appears to be an essential step in specific models of agonist-induced vascular permeability and tissue edema. Our laboratory's earlier work (41), as well as ongoing studies (11) utilizing the cell-permeable tyrosine kinase activator and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor diperoxovanadate (DPV), strongly suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation participates in the regulation of endothelial cell contractile forces via direct effects on MLCK activity and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Proteins that promote endothelial cell tethering to each other or to the extracellular matrix include adherens proteins, such as the homotypic cadherins and -, -, and -catenins, which, in some systems, are regulated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation (4, 45). Similarly, the integrity of matrix-integrin-cytoskeleton linkages is dependent on focal contacts through which signaling occurs by the activation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase that mediates phosphorylation of focal adhesion plaque proteins such as paxillin (3, 36, 48).

 Compared with WT18E6 and Leu18E6 cells, Glu18E6 cells had an increased tendency to associate with neighbouring cells (Fig. 3). The restoration of intercellular association in these cells was most probably largely attributable to an increase in the formation of epithelial cadherin-based adhesion junctions (AJs and desmosomes) at intercellular contact sites (Fig. 6A,B). This was not however, a result of increased protein levels of the individual cell adhesion proteins such as E-cadherin and &#223;-catenin, as these remained unchanged between all of the E6 cell lines (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that Glu18E6 cells might have an increased ability to initiate assembly of junctions and/or maintain their integrity compared with WT18E6 cells. A decrease in the levels of PDZ proteins such as Dlg could be the basis for the loss of integrity of adhesion structures in WT18E6 and Leu18E6 cells. Studies of dlg-1(RNAi) embryos of C. elegans, in which AJs disassemble, suggest that Dlg is a probable candidate to participate in the organization of a protein scaffold that controls the assembly of junctions (Bossinger et al., 2001; Firestein and Rongo, 2001).

 The role of tensin as an adaptor for integrin and as a required component in focal adhesions suggests the possibility that it may act as a mediator of integrin signaling. In support of this idea, much indirect and direct evidence has been collected. Previously, the SH2 and PTB domains in the C terminus of tensin have been demonstrated to bind tyrosine phosphorylated proteins such as PI3K and p130 CAS (Salgia et al., 1995; Salgia et al., 1996; Auger et al., 1996). In addition, tensin itself is phosphorylated at serine, threonine and tyrosine residues when cells are stimulated by either cell adhesion (Bockholt and Burridge, 1993), growth factors (Jiang et al., 1996) or oncogenes, including v-Src and Bcr/Abl (Davis et al., 1991; Salgia et al., 1995). Indeed, a recent study has shown that overexpression of tensin alone can activate JNK in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Katz et al., 2000). According to this report, the tensin-mediated JNK activities are independent of the activities of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rac and Cdc42, but dependent on the activity of SEK (Katz et al., 2000).

 WEIGHT LOSS IS A MAJOR CAUSE of morbidity and mortality in advanced cancer (14, 32, 43). This weight loss has proven difficult to reverse, and it has been suggested that the metabolic response to cancer prevents the efficient use of food (29). Part of this metabolic response is the hepatic acute-phase protein response. The acute-phase protein response has been shown to be associated with hypermetabolism, accelerated weight loss (17, 38, 45), and poor survival in patients with advanced cancer (7, 18). The acute-phase protein response is characterized by elevated circulating concentration of so-called positive acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, and reduced concentrations of negative acute-phase proteins, such as albumin (6). The circulating concentrations of these proteins depend on their rates of synthesis (largely in the liver), degradation, and transcapillary escape. The potential importance of the acute-phase response is that, in patients with inadequate nutritional intake, the net increase in hepatic protein synthesis may provide an increased drain on the protein store of the body, the skeletal muscle, and thus accelerate loss of lean tissue (34).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES &nbsp; Analysis of recombination in meiotic cells Meiotic division begins with a period of cell division characterized by four distinct stages of prophase: the leptotene, zygotene, pachytene and diplotene stages. DNA replication begins in the pre-leptotene to leptotene stages and the sister chromatids begin to condense (Fig.&#160;1A). Then in zygotene, the sister chromatids synapse along their length and form lateral elements that contain synaptonemal complex proteins (SCP), such as SCP2 and SCP3 (Fig.&#160;1B and C). At pachytene, SC formation is complete and recombination nodules that contain proteins such as MLH1 are clearly visible (Fig.&#160;1D and E). Finally, at the diplotene stage, homologous chromosomes begin to separate and only the chiasmata, the sites of the recombination machinery, hold the chromosomes together (Fig.&#160;1F). Meiotic division continues to progress in an orderly fashion from meiosis I to meiosis II, unless errors in the recombination or chromosomal segregation machinery trigger arrest at one of two checkpoints, either during prophase or at the metaphase&#150;anaphase transition (23,24). In men, completion of meiosis requires 30&#150;35 days (25).

 How can the same receptor system give rise to such divergent biological responses such as cell death and cell proliferation? Through its interaction with the p55 and p75 receptors, TNF can potentially generate second messengers, such as ceramide (42) and proinflammatory metabolites (15). The activity of PIP5K versus other signaling activities may determine whether cells respond to TNF by cell proliferation or apoptosis. Discrete actions by TNF may be dictated by the presence or absence of cellular proteins, such as TRADD or PIP5K. Other proteins, such as FADD, RIP, and TRAF2, can be recruited as a result of these initial interactions with TRADD (43, 44). When multiple proteins are present, the affinity of binding with the receptor will undoubtedly dictate the choice of the signaling pathway. It is important to note that the binding of PIP5KII to the p55 receptor was not observed with other family members, such as Fas and the p75 neurotrophin receptor, and that PIP5KII interacted preferentially over PIP5KII (Fig. 5C). These interactions would be expected to take place only in specific cell types, thereby providing the diversity in signaling potential by this cytokine family.

 The cytosolic events that lead to the formation and release of vesicles from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ()were reconstituted with the use of an enriched ER fraction and three purified cytosolic fractions (Sec13/31p, Sec23/24p, and Sar1p) that comprise a novel coat protein complex, COPII (Salama et al., 1993; Barlowe et al., 1994). A system comprising these factors and GTP support the inclusion of cargo proteins such as glycosylated pro--factor (gpf) into 60-mm vesicles that bud from the ER (Barlowe et al., 1994). In addition to cargo proteins, ER-derived vesicles contain synaptobrevin-like proteins such as Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sec22p (Barlowe et al., 1994; Lian and Ferro-Novick., 1993; Rexach et al., 1994), the targeting molecules that function as specificity factors by serving as the docking ``v-SNARE'' in the consumption of vesicles by the Golgi apparatus (Rothman, 1994). The absence of ER resident proteins in these transport vesicles suggests that cargo proteins are faithfully sorted from other ER lumenal proteins (Rexach et al., 1994). Thus, the COPII proteins plus GTP are sufficient to provide the cytosolic information necessary to reproduce an authentic vesicle budding

 The observation that integrin receptor clustering leads to autophosphorylation of a tyrosine kinase has suggested that integrin signaling may resemble the signal transduction pathway initiated by peptide mitogens. In that case, mitogen binding triggers dimerization and autophosphorylation of a receptor tyrosine kinase, binding of adaptor proteins such as Grb2 or Shc, recruitment of guanine nucleotide exchange proteins such as Sos, and subsequent activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase kinase (MEK)/MAP kinase signal transduction cascade (Egan and Weinberg, 1993; Khosravi-Far and Der, 1994). In a somewhat parallel set of events, following FAK autophosphorylation, additional tyrosines are phosphorylated through the action of Src-family kinases that bind to FAK at Y397 via their SH2 domains (Schaller et al., 1994; Calab et al., 1995). This leads to the binding of other SH2 domain proteins such as PI-3kinase (Bachelot et al., 1996) and the Grb2/Sos complex (Schlaepfer et al., 1994). The binding of Grb2/Sos at Y925 of FAK raises the possibility that FAK activation may be able to trigger the Ras signal transduction cascade (Schlaepfer et al., 1994). Further, several groups have shown that MAP kinases are activated in response to integrinmediated adhesion (Chen et al., 1994; Schlaepfer et al., 1994; Zhu and Assoian, 1995), and we have recently shown that MEK and Raf-1 are also activated in this way (Chen et al., 1996). Other workers have suggested a role for Ras in integrin signaling (Kapron-Bras et al., 1993; Clark and Hynes, 1996). All of the data above suggest a link between integrins, FAK, and the consensus Ras/MAP kinase pathway. However, when we directly tested the relationship of integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation to the Ras pathway, using transfection with dominant negative constructs for that pathway, we found no evidence for Ras involvement (Chen et al., 1996). Thus, we find at least one notable difference in the integrin- and mitogen-mediated pathways leading to MAP kinase activation, with a lack of Ras involvement in the integrin-mediated events.

 The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 family of transcription factors has been shown to play a key role in the differentiation processes of a number of cell lineages (1-3). These proteins contain an HLH domain consisting of two amphipathic helixes separated by a loop, which mediates homo- and heterodimerization, plus an adjacent DNA-binding region rich in basic amino acids (4, 5). The bHLH proteins bind to a DNA sequence known as an E-box (CANNTG) or to the related N-box (CACNAG) (6, 7). There are two major categories of bHLH. The class A are ubiquitously expressed proteins such as those encoded by the differently spliced transcripts of the E2A (E12, E47, and E2-5/ITF1), E2-2/ITF2, and HEB/HTF4 genes (5, 8-10). Class B comprises tissue-specific bHLH proteins such as MyoD, NeuroD, MASH, and TAL (1-3, 11, 12). Dimerization is essential for binding and transcriptional regulation in vivo, and in general tissue-specific bHLH form heterodimers with a partner from the ubiquitously expressed class A family (13, 14). These factors form an interacting network that regulate transcription of several genes.

 At the amino terminus there are two additional binding domains (dsRBD I and II) that might provide specificity for RNA (6). Similar motifs are conserved among a group of dsRNA-binding proteins, such as dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (DAI) (7), dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase (DRADA) (8), Escherichia coli RNase III (9), the Drosophila staufen protein, the Xenopus laevis RNA-binding protein Xlrbpa, the human transactivator region binding protein (10, 11), and the vaccinia virus E3L protein (12). The carboxyl-terminal 100&nbsp;amino acids of NDH II consist of a consecutive stretch of glycines that is regularly interrupted by either aromatic amino acids or arginine. Similar RGG-rich sequences (RGG-boxes) have been found as part of many nucleic acid-binding proteins, such as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNP A1 (13) and hnRNP U (14), nucleolin (15), yeast single-strand DNA-binding protein 1&nbsp;(16), as well as of other proteins from the superfamily of DEX(D/H) helicases (17-23). Except hnRNP U, where the RGG-box is the only nucleic acid binding domain (14), RGG-boxes cooperate with other domains to achieve an increased affinity for nucleic acids.

 Integrin receptor binding to extracellular matrix proteins generates intracellular signals through tyrosine phosphorylation events that are important for cell growth, survival, and migration (2). In various cell types, integrin clustering triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins through the activation of a large number of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 and the Src-family of kinases. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins is one of the earliest responses stimulated by integrin receptor activation when cells contact matrix protein such as fibronectin (FN). Upon replating of cells on fibronectin, FAK becomes activated either through conformational changes or as a result of aggregation mediated by integrin clustering. FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 under these conditions promotes the transient association of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases with FAK and the formation of a signaling complex. In addition, FAK associates with several different signaling proteins such as p130Cas, Shc, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and paxillin. This association enables FAK to function within a network of integrin-stimulated signaling pathways, leading to the activation of targets such as the ERK and JNK/mitogen activated protein kinase pathways (1-5).

 The mislocalization of F-actin patches by hob3 null cells has been previously observed in mutants of the Arp2/3 complex of S.&nbsp;pombe, as well as in mutants of other, known actin-interacting proteins such as the products of the cdc3+ and cdc8+ genes, which encode profilin and tropomyosin, respectively (44, 45, 57, 58). However, these mutants do not display the linear, multiseptated morphology characteristic of hob3 cells. In addition, loss of Cdc3p, Cdc8p, or Arp3p function is lethal, whereas loss of Hob3p is not. Given that the major defect in these mutants is probably actin-related, and that perturbations of actin organization generally result in gross morphological defects throughout the cell cycle, it is not surprising that the hob3+ gene is not essential, nor do hob3 cells exhibit the profound morphological abnormalities observed in more severe cases of loss of actin organization, such as in the cdc3 mutant (58). Nevertheless, a defect in F-actin patch movement is apparent in hob3 cells. It remains to be determined whether Hob3p is directly associated with actin or with actin-binding proteins such as profilin, tropomyosin, or the Arp2/3 complex.

 If 1-adrenergic receptors can form 1AR/1AR homodimers (14), 1AR/2AR heterodimers (15), and 1AR/2AAR heterodimers, as the present data reveal, it is a point of significant interest to understand the factors that regulate the proportion of cellular homodimers versus heterodimers. Studies on the dimerization of other GPCRs have provided evidence that agonist stimulation can regulate dimerization (9). However, as mentioned above, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments did not reveal any consistent effects of agonist stimulation on 2AAR/1AR heterodimerization. Association with cytoplasmic scaffold proteins is another factor that might potentially regulate heterodimer formation. The 1-adrenergic receptor is known to associate with PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology domain-containing scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 (14, 41, 42) and MAGI-2 (14). However, we have not observed any significant effects of PSD-95 or MAGI-2 coexpression on the extent of either 1AR/1AR homodimerization (14) or 2AAR/1AR heterodimerization (data not shown). The 2A-adrenergic receptor is known to associate with cytoplasmic proteins such as 14-3-3&nbsp;(43) and spinophilin (44), but we have not examined the effects of these interactions on 2AAR/1AR heterodimerization.

 EhEBP1 and EhEBP2 Contain Regions Homologous to the RNA Recognition Motif-- Examination of the amino acid sequences of EhEBP1 and EhEBP2 by searching computer data bases did not detect any motifs commonly associated with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Surprisingly, both EhEBP1 and EhEBP2 contained regions of homology to the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a nucleotide binding motif found in a large group of RNA-binding proteins (24, 25). The RRM is also present in several sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, such as stage-specific activator protein (SSAP) (26). EhEBP1 contained two full copies of the RRM as well as a 54-amino acid region with many acidic and basic residues (Fig. 4A). EhEBP2 contained one and a half copies of the RRM as well as a 58-amino acid region with many acidic and basic residues. Alignment with representative RNA- and DNA-binding, RRM-containing proteins revealed the presence of many well conserved amino acids within the RRMs of EhEBP1 and EhEBP2 (Fig. 4B). Sequence homology was also seen between the RRMs of EhEBP1 and EhEBP2 in regions not well conserved between different RRM-containing proteins, such as loop 3.&nbsp;

 From the different responses in diverse experimental systems, the question arose whether the differences could be explained mechanistically. Changes in endothelial barrier function are usually due to one of two principal mechanisms: the first is based on activation or inactivation of the actin-myosin-based contractile machinery, which is triggered by the phosphorylation state of myosin light chains (MLC). The phosphorylation state of this regulatory subunit is balanced by a Ca2+-dependent MLC kinase (MLCK) and a MLC phosphatase (MLCP), the activity of which is regulated by various signaling pathways (4, 6, 15, 42). Activation of the contractile apparatus causes changes in cell shape, opening of intercellular gaps and, thereby, a change in barrier function. Not only in cultured endothelial monolayers but also in intact vessels such as coronary venules, activation of the contractile machinery has been identified as the dominant mechanism to increase permeability (43). The second mechanism is based on the stabilization or destabilization of cell-cell or cell-matrix junctions. In endothelial cell junctions, several adhesion molecules are clustered in multiprotein complexes in which transmembrane proteins such as VE-cadherins (17) or integrins (18) bind to corresponding adhesion proteins at adjacent cells or to the extracellular matrix, respectively. These proteins are linked via intermediate proteins, such as catenins or paxillin, to the actin-based cytoskeleton at the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. Assembly and disassembly of these cell adhesion complexes are controlled by intracellular signaling mechanisms, e.g., the cAMP/PKA pathway. It has been shown that phosphorylation of cell-cell and cell-matrix junction proteins, such as catenins, vinculin, or paxillin, can provoke disintegration of these complexes (9, 17, 18, 25, 26, 38, 39). As a result, cells detach from their immediate neighbors or from extracellular matrix. Concomitant shape changes and opening of intercellular gaps are the basis for an increase in permeability (6, 20, 21, 24, 26, 34). It is as yet unclear to which extent contractile machinery and cell junctions contribute to the divergent effects of cAMP/PKA signals in endothelial barriers.

 The activity of HNF-4 has been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (36&#150;38) and, more recently, by its interaction with other proteins such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (39, 40), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (41), or the small heterodimer partner (42). Such modulations of HNF-4 activity have been demonstrated to be responsible for regulation of the expression of several metabolic genes. Whatever the signaling pathway involved in HNF-4 activity, it could be triggered by lipid micelles by different means. A receptor/transporter located in the brush border membrane of the enterocyte could specifically detect the lipid micelles. Such a mechanism has been suggested for the sensing of dietary sugars by intestinal cells, in which dietary glucose would be sensed by the glucose co-transporter SGLT1 and would generate an intracellular signal involving the activation of G-protein and a cAMP/protein kinase A signaling cascade (43). Dietary lipids are also known to modify the composition of the cell membrane and its fluidity (44, 45), with major consequences on the functions of the membrane and membrane-embedded proteins such as enzymes or receptors (46, 47).

 Glycosylation on serines and threonines has been described for a variety of proteins, from the ones responsible for the ABO blood types (Bundle, 1995), to structural proteins like glycophorin and collagen, and secreted proteins like mucines. Signaling proteins such as chorionic gonadotropin, erythropoietin, and some interleukins also contain O-linked sugars and it has been suggested that this posttranslational modification prolongs the life of cell surface components and of secreted proteins by protecting them from circulating proteases. The LDL and transferrin receptors, two cell surface proteins required for the utilization of cholesterol and iron from the extracellular space are O-glycosylated (Cummings et al., 1983; Hayes et al., 1992). It has been demonstrated for the transferrin receptor that the presence of the O-linked sugar protects the protein from tryptic-like proteases encountered by the receptor in its normal cycle of internalization and externalization (Rutledge and Enns, 1996). Other membrane proteins such as the Na+/H+ exchangers NHE-1 and NHE-2 have also been reported to be O-glycosylated (Counillon et al., 1994; Tse et al., 1994), but until now this modification had not been identified in receptors involved in signal

 &nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures found at the ends of linear chromosomes that protect chromosomal DNA from degradation, recombination and detrimental fusion events (1). In humans, telomeres are composed of telomeric DNA, consisting of tandem repeats of short sequences (TTAGGG), that are synthesized by the enzyme telomerase (1). The human telomerase enzyme is minimally composed of the reverse transcriptase, hTERT and the RNA component, hTR. hTERT utilizes hTR as a template to add the TTAGGG repeats onto the 3' ends of the chromosome (1,2). In addition to this role as a polymerase, the hTERT/hTR complex also cooperates with a conglomerate of other proteins to form the nucleoprotein &#145;cap&#146; at chromosome termini. These proteins include telomeric DNA-binding proteins, such as TRF1 and TRF2 (3), and DNA repair proteins, such as the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex (4). Maintenance of this telomere cap involves an intricate, highly regulated network of protein&#150;protein, protein&#150;DNA and protein&#150;RNA interactions, which are crucial for the protection of the genome. Misregulation of this process has been associated with cellular senescence and transformation to a malignant state (5).

 The RS domain has been shown to mediate protein&#150;protein (14) and protein&#150;RNA interactions (15), to function in nuclear import (16&#150;18) and to play a role in the targeting of proteins such as SC35 and Transformer (19) to nuclear speckles. RS domains from SR proteins, non-SR proteins and synthetic RS domains have also been shown to activate splicing (20). However, the RS domain does not appear to facilitate nuclear import and localization for all RS domain proteins, as SF2/ASF and SRp40 are capable of localization to nuclear speckles in the absence of this domain (21). Where nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of RS domain proteins such as SF2/ASF, U2AF and 9G8 has been demonstrated, the RS domain is required, but not sufficient for cytoplasmic localization (22). Nuclear import can be dependent on RS domain phosphorylation and is mediated by SR transportins (TRN-SR) in both mammals (17,18) and Drosophila (16). The export pathways for SR proteins have not been defined, but can also be influenced by phosphorylation status (23,24). It is now emerging that RS domain phosphorylation also functions in mRNA export (25) and RNA binding specificity (26).

 Many soluble plant vacuolar proteins are sorted away from proteins destined for secretion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN)1, a process that requires the presence of positive sorting signals on the vacuolar proteins. Three types of sorting signals have been described for soluble vacuolar proteins in plants (reviewed in Matsuoka and Neuhaus 1999 ; Vitale and Raikhel 1999 ). Some proteins, such as barley aleurain (barley Aleu) and sweet potato sporamin (Spo), contain a cleavable NH2-terminal propeptide (NTPP) that functions as a sorting signal; others (e.g., barley lectin [BL] and tobacco chitinase A [TobChit]) contain a cleavable COOH-terminal propeptide (CTPP). Finally, some mature proteins, such as phytohemagglutinin and legumin, contain an internal targeting determinant. These targeting signals appear to be specific to plants because plant vacuolar proteins expressed in yeast are targeted to the yeast vacuole by a mechanism that is independent of the plant sorting signals (Matsuoka and Nakamura 1992 ; Chao and Etzler 1994 ; Gal and Raikhel 1994 ). Targeting of mammalian lysosomal proteins also differs: sorting signals are not encoded by the amino acid sequence, but rather involve posttranslationally added sugar modifications, such as phosphomannosyl residues (reviewed in Kornfeld 1992 ).

 CaM is a highly conserved Ca2+-binding protein that modulates the activities of many Ca2+-dependent enzymes and also the functional activities of different transport and structural proteins (for a review, see Ref. 38). In most cases, Ca2+ is essential for the initial binding of CaM to these proteins and for subsequent modulation of their function. However, a small subset of proteins including 4.1R (12, 15) bind CaM in a Ca2+-independent manner but require Ca2+ for manifesting changes in function. Previous studies have shown that CaM in association with Ca2+ at concentrations greater than 2&nbsp;&#181;M diminishes 4.1R interactions with band 3&nbsp;as well as GPC (12, 39). Recently, the 4.1R interaction with CD44 has been documented to be modulated by Ca2+ and CaM (8). In an analogous fashion, the present study demonstrated that the 4.1R interactions with GPC and p55 are also modulated by Ca2+ and CaM. These findings raise the possibility that increases in intracellular concentration of Ca2+ can modulate binding of 4.1R not only to transmembrane proteins such as band 3,&nbsp;GPC, and CD44 but also to other membrane skeletal proteins such as p55.

 In vitro studies as well as immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that FMRP is able to self-associate and to heterodimerize with the two homologous proteins FXR1P and FXR2P (10,22). In addition, several FMRP interacting proteins such as NUFIP1 (23), CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 (24) and 82-FIP (25) have been described recently. All these interactor proteins bind directly to FMRP in the N-terminus region, predominantly in domains lying between the NLS and the first KH motif (26). Other proteins such as Nucleolin, p50, both RNA-binding proteins (27,28) and Pur alpha, mStauffen, Myosin Va (29) have been shown to be components of FMRP-containing complexes. In Drosophila, the dFMRP, the common ancestor and ortholog of FMRP, FXR1P and FXR2P, is associated with the RISC complex together with AGO2 and DICER (30,31). However, evidence for direct interactions of FMRP with these proteins is lacking. A new domain in human FMRP as well as in Drosophila dFMRP has been shown to be phosphorylated. This domain is situated between the RGG box and the NES and it has been proposed that phosphorylation of FMRP could play a role in regulating its physiological functions (32).

 In summary, then, our studies have localized Phex protein to osteoblastic and especially osteocytic cells and suggest that the hypomineralized periosteocytic lesions in Hyp bone may be a local consequence of Phex deficiency in the osteocyte. A reduction in some bone matrix proteins, such as bone sialoprotein and vitronectin, can be observed both in Hyp bone in vivo and in Hyp BMC cultures in vitro, whereas elevations in other bone matrix proteins, such as biglycan and fibrillin-1, may be seen. This perturbation of the normal complement of bone matrix protein may contribute to the impaired mineralization observed in Hyp bone and could potentially account for the inhibitory effect on normal bone cell mineralization previously reported to be elicited by Hyp bone cells (7, 16). Based on analyses of osteogenic cells in vitro, these alterations in bone matrix protein concentrations may result from diminished gene expression or from altered posttranslational handling of these proteins. These studies demonstrate that osteogenic cell disturbances may occur independently of ambient phosphate concentrations and may therefore be of equal importance for the generation of the Hyp phenotype as the much studied changes in renal function in this disorder.

 ENZYME CYTOCHEMISTRY and subcellular fractionation have shown that lysosomal enzymes are synthesized early in the maturation of neutrophilic leukocytes in bone marrow (BM).1-5 These enzymes are stored within azurophilic (or primary) granules for 10&nbsp;to 14&nbsp;days before being used during phagocytosis. The azurophilic granules were considered by de Duve6 to be classic examples of primary lysosomes since they are membrane-bound organelles that contain acid hydrolases that have not yet entered into a digestive event. These granules, which are formed at the promyelocytic stage (see Table 1),7-9 are the major source of acid hydrolases and many other proteins such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), granulocyte elastases, and nonglycosylated defensins. However, little is known of their membranes. Only CD6310,11 and CD6812 have been demonstrated in the membrane of azurophilic granules. Two other granule populations, which are nonlysosomal and peroxidase-negative, form later in maturation: specific or secondary granules,13 which contain lactoferrin and many other substances, and the gelatinase or tertiary granules, which form mainly at the band cell stage.14 Also, highly mobilizable secretory vesicles that contain endocytosed plasma proteins such as albumin have recently been characterized.15,16

 In addition to self homo- or heterodimerization, Jun and Fos proteins selectively partner with other related bZIP families of proteins (Fig. 5), including ATFs, C/EBPs, Nrf/Mafs, and helix-loop-helix ZIP proteins, such as upstream stimulatory factors (USFs) (20). Furthermore, they can physically interact with non-ZIP proteins, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells, Ets, NF-B, glucocorticoid receptor, CREB-binding protein, and TATA-binding protein (20). These interactions not only increase the complexity and repertoire of the protein factors present in a given cell type but also result in differential DNA binding and transactivation activities, thereby tightly controlling AP-1-dependent gene expression in various biological processes (20). In addition, the involvement of a variety of MAPK modules that differentially activate various partners can also integrate signals elicited by diverse stimuli. The interactions between AP-1 proteins and non-ZIP proteins and their role in inflammatory and immune responses have been discussed elsewhere (33, 36, 54, 83). In this review, we briefly discuss some of the potential interactions between AP-1 and other bZIP proteins and their role in regulation of gene expression in cells of the lung.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES &nbsp; In addition to their structural role, integrin-associated costameres (and their focal adhesion counterparts in cultured cardiomyocytes) are also sites for the localization of signaling molecules that are important in cardiomyocyte survival and growth. These include protein tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), Src, and c-Src-kinase (Csk), and serine-threonine protein kinases such as integrin-linked kinase (ILK), protein kinase C (PKC), and p21-activated kinase (PAK). Other adaptor proteins, such as paxillin, Crk, DOCK180, and Crk-associated substrate (Cas), can link focal adhesion proteins to other downstream signaling cascades that may be important in both mechanotransduction and growth factor signaling. In general, there appears to be substantial cross talk between integrins and growth factor receptors in many cell types, suggesting that integrin- and growth factor-mediated cellular responses are locally coordinated within focal adhesions (34).

 The members of the BCL-2 family can be subdivided into antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w and proapoptotic proteins such as BAX, BOD, BOK, and BAD. It has been proposed that anti- and proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins regulate cell death by binding to each other and forming heterodimers (10, 11). A delicate balance between anti- and proapoptotic BCL-2 family members exists in each cell, and the relative concentration of these two groups of proteins determines whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis. MCL-1 was first discovered as an early induction gene during the differentiation of a human myeloid leukemia cell line (12). Although the MCL-11 protein possesses the BCL-2 homology (BH)1, BH2, BH3, and transmembrane (TM) domains found in other BCL-2-related proteins, it is distinguished by a unique PEST sequence in its N-terminal region. Subsequent studies established MCL-1 as an antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein with an expression pattern differing from that of BCL-2 and capable of suppressing cell death induced by various stimuli including growth factor deprivation and exposure to chemotherapeutic agents or UV irradiation (13, 14).

 The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of MAPK family which can be activated by numerous environmental stresses including heavy metals, UV light, -radiation, DNA-damaging agents, cytotoxic drugs and protein synthesis inhibitors (5&#150;7). The stress activated JNK has been shown to regulate several physiological and pathological processes, including growth arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, transformation and survival (5&#150;7). The multiplex roles of JNK primarily depend on the stimuli, cell types, duration of kinase activation and specific isoforms. The JNK is activated through upstream kinases MKK4 or MKK7, which can be activated by many MKKK (5&#150;7). In addition to sequential physical interactions between members of a three-kinase module, scaffold proteins such as JNK interacting proteins organize the JNK into a specific signaling cassette to ensure the specificity in kinase activation (1,5&#150;7). The JNK signal module can be inactivated by various MAPK phosphatases including MKP1, MKP2 and PP2A (8&#150;10) and also negative regulated by redox-sensitive proteins such as thioredoxin and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (12,13). In general, the activity of JNK reflects a balance between the actions of upstream kinases and negative control systems.

 substrates.PTPH1 was isolated as a putative intracellular PTP from a HeLa cell cDNA library(4) . PTPH1 and PTPMEG1(5) , as well as the recently identified PTP-BAS/1E/L1 (6, 7, 8) and PTPD1/RL10/2E(9, 10, 11) , constitute an expanding subfamily of PTPs that contain NH-terminal segments of homology to cytoskeleton-associated proteins of the band 4.1 superfamily that includes band 4.1, ezrin, talin, radixin, moesin, and merlin. The catalytic domain of PTPH1 is contained in the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule separated from the NH-terminal, band 4.1-related domain by a central segment that contains a GLGF (or DHR) sequence motif (residues 511-596, 30% identity and 57% similarity to GLGF-repeat I in the Drosophila tumor suppressor discs-large (Dlg)) (12) and a potential SH3 binding site (residues 69-77, PSRSPPITP). The function of GLGF motifs is currently unknown, but in addition to the band 4.1-related PTPs, they have been found in a rapidly expanding family of intracellular proteins such as erythrocyte palmitoylated protein p55, nitric oxide synthase, postsynaptic density protein Psd-95, and tight junction protein ZO-1(13) . Recently, the GLGF region from human Dlg was shown to bind the amino-terminal domain of protein 4.1(14) . Band 4.1 homology domains are responsible for targeting cytoskeleton-associated proteins to cytoskeleton-membrane interfaces (15) , as illustrated in the association of band 4.1 with glycophorin and p55 (16) and that of moesin with CD44(17) . The presence of such a targeting domain implies that PTPH1 may be also directed to cytoskeleton-membrane interfaces and that the substrate selectivity of PTPH1 may be determined, at least in part, by its subcellular localization. If so, cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as band 4.1 or ezrin, tyrosine phosphorylation of which correlates with their redistribution into the cytoskeleton(18, 19, 20) , may be typical substrates of this enzyme in vivo. Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeleton- and membrane-associated proteins such as ezrin has been linked to malignant transformation(21, 22)

 We describe and discuss a method of protein extraction for Western blot analysis from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. From 5-mm2 50-&#181;m-thick tissue sections, an abundance of proteins could be extracted by incubating the sections in lysis buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 100C for 20 min followed by incubation at 60C for 2 hr. Extracts yielded discernible protein bands ranging from 10 kD to 120 kD as identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Western blot analysis successfully detected membrane-bound protein such as E-cadherin, cytosolic protein such as &#223;-catenin, and nuclear proteins including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), mutant-type p53, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). With this technique, we could examine cyclin D1 and CDK2 expression in small adenomas compared with cancer tissues and normal mucosa. The simple method of protein extraction described here should make it possible to use large-scale archives of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples for Western blot analysis, and its application could lead to detailed analysis of protein expression. This new technique should yield valuable information for molecular biology. (J Histochem Cytochem 46:397&#150;403, 1998)

 The proline-rich domain of stonin 2 contains two NPF motifs that mediate interactions with the EH domains of Eps15, Eps15R, and intersectin 1. This property is shared with other NPF-containing endocytic proteins such as epsin 1 (Chen et al. 1998 ; Yamabhai et al. 1998 ), epsin 2 (Yamabhai et al. 1998 ; Rosenthal et al. 1999 ), the 170-kD form of synaptojanin (Haffner et al. 1997 ), nonneuronal members of the AP180/CALM family (Dreyling et al. 1996 ; Tebar et al. 1999 ), several SCAMP isoforms (Fernandez-Chacon et al. 2000 ), and Numb (Santolini et al. 2000 ). Despite the fact that all of these NPF-containing proteins share the same EH-containing partners, interactions between them and Eps15 need not be competitive since Eps15 is a tetramer (Cupers et al. 1997 ; Tebar et al. 1997 ) and could thus assemble simultaneously with several NPF-containing proteins. The proline-rich domains of stonin 1 and stonin 2 also contain several PxxP motifs that could potentially interact with SH3 domains of endocytic proteins such as intersectins, amphiphysins, and endophilins (for review see Slepnev and De Camilli 2000 ), or with other domains that recognize proline-based motifs (Kay et al. 2000 ).

 &nbsp;&nbsp; RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; Characterization of Proteins Associated with Melanization&#151;To identify melanin-regulatory proteins in insect hemolymph, we first prepared G-100 solution from Tenebrio hemolymph. This solution showed PO activity by incubation with 1,3--D-glucan and Ca2+. Melanin pigments were induced when the G-100 solution was incubated with dopamine in the presence of 1,3--D-glucan and Ca2+. After induction of melanization, the supernatants of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1A, six proteins clearly disappeared after a 30-min incubation (lane 8) compared with the G-100 solution (lane 4), indicating that these proteins are associated with melanin synthesis. It is known that melanins induced by arthropod PO are closely linked to protein matrices in the form of melanoproteins (7&#150;9). We assumed that if some proteins in hemolymph were used in melanin synthesis, they would disappear as positive regulatory proteins such as MEPs during the melanization reaction. If some proteins functioned as negative regulatory proteins such as MIPs, they should be generated or degraded from the hemolymph when the melanization reaction was started.

 Several effector molecules for RhoA have been identified so far that are either scaffold proteins such as rhophilin, Rhotekin, kinectin, and diaphanous or serine/threonine protein kinases such as protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK1,1 also called protein kinase N or PKN), citron kinase, and Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) (9, 11). Rhophilin-like proteins (rhophilin-1/2, p76RBE) participate in the control of spermatozoa motility (12), cAMP-controlled signaling in thyroid cells (13), and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (14). Rhotekin is involved in gene transcription (15), whereas diaphanous proteins influence actin polymerization and microtubule organization (16, 17). Kinectin, which binds to kinesin and enhances its microtubule-dependent ATPase activity, has been shown to bind Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and RhoG in a GTP-dependent manner (18&#150;20). The biological significance of the interaction between kinectin and RhoA, however, remains unclear. ROCK proteins phosphorylate several substrates, leading to various cellular responses such as smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth (21). PRK proteins are involved in the control of transcription factors, mitogenesis, apoptosis, and cell adhesion (22), whereas citron kinase function is implicated in cytokinesis (23&#150;26) and cell cycle regulation (27).

 Three other AKAPs appear to have distinct targeting sequences but have been not been analyzed in depth. AKAP220 may be targeted to peroxisomes (22) as the last 3&nbsp;residues of the protein, Cys-Arg-Leu, conform to a peroxisomal targeting signal 1&nbsp;motif, which is thought to facilitate the attachment of proteins to the lipid matrix of the peroxisome (47). AKAP250 is a component of the membrane/cytoskeleton, which is enriched in the filopodia of adherent human erythroleukemia cells (24). The N terminus of AKAP250 contains a consensus myristoylation signal, as well as other structural regions that bear some resemblance to actin-binding proteins such as MARCKS and GAP-43 (48). Likewise, an anchoring protein previously called AKAP78 has now been identified as the cytoskeletal component ezrin (49). In fact, ezrin and its two close relatives, radaxin and moesin, bind RII in the overlay assay. All three proteins (ezrin, radaxin, moesin) are members of the band 4.1&nbsp;superfamily of proteins, which link the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Therefore, cross-linking from the membrane to the cytoskeleton might be a shared function of anchoring proteins such as AKAP79, AKAP250, and ezrin, radaxin, moesin (Fig. 2A).

 unwinding.Despite the heterologous nature of this system, inferences can be made concerning the in vivo applicability of such studies. Within the E. coli cell, the chromosomal DNA is assembled into higher order structure by small, basic proteins such as HU and IHF. In addition, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as repressors and other regulatory proteins will be bound to the DNA. Although this problem is typically ignored when in vitro studies are performed, it is clear that any global process such as replication, recombination, or repair must deal with these types of nucleoprotein structures. From these results, we propose that one method by which this is accomplished is through the action of a DNA helicase. In E. coli, helicases play critical roles in each of these processes, and perhaps one reason for this is that such an activity is required to clear the DNA of other proteinDNA complexes. The in vitro biochemistry of these processes as derived from eukaryotic organisms is not as developed, but it is not unreasonable to propose a similar, and perhaps even more critical, role for DNA helicases in these organisms, which contain the additional barrier of highly condensed

 &nbsp;&nbsp; SUMMARY TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion REFERENCES &nbsp; PAR proteins distribute asymmetrically across the anterior-posterior axis of the 1-cell-stage C. elegans embryo, and function to establish subsequent anterior-posterior asymmetries. By the end of the 4-cell stage, anteriorly localized PAR proteins, such as PAR-3 and PAR-6, redistribute to the outer, apical surfaces of cells, whereas posteriorly localized PAR proteins, such as PAR-1 and PAR-2, redistribute to the inner, basolateral surfaces. Because PAR proteins are provided maternally, distinguishing apicobasal from earlier anterior-posterior functions requires a method that selectively prevents PAR activity after the 1-cell stage. In the present study we generated hybrid PAR proteins that are targeted for degradation after the 1-cell stage. Embryos containing the hybrid PAR proteins had normal anterior-posterior polarity, but showed defects in apicobasal asymmetries associated with gastrulation. Ectopic separations appeared between lateral surfaces of cells that are normally tightly adherent, cells that ingress during gastrulation failed to accumulate nonmuscle myosin at their apical surfaces and ingression was slowed. Thus, PAR proteins function in both apicobasal and anterior-posterior asymmetry during the first few cell cycles of embryogenesis.

 Sam68 is a target of the c-Src tyrosine kinase (21, 22). It contains an hnRNP-K homology domain (KH domain) (23) that mediates RNA binding and protein-protein interaction (24). The KH domain has also been reported in several RNA-binding proteins such as GRP33 (25), fragile X mental retardation gene product FMR-1 (26), and the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line-specific tumor suppressor GLD-1 (27), and as recently reported, other proteins such as SLM-1, SLM-2 (28), QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7 (29, 30). In this study, we have investigated the role of KH proteins in the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV replication. Here, we report that KH proteins (SLM-1, SLM-2, QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7), that have partial homology with Sam68 failed to transactivate RRE-directed reporter gene expression independent of Rev, but are able to enhance Rev transactivation on RRE. These effects were sensitive to LMB, but insensitive to olomoucine. Our results provide the first direct evidence that other members of KH proteins are also involved in post-transcriptional regulation of HIV gene expression. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES

 Many basic cellular functions are dependent on rapid and localized reorganization of actin filaments in response to external or internal signals, and Ca2+-sensitive proteins often play a key role in the regulation of these processes (1-3). Actin-binding proteins of the gelsolin family represent an important class of cellular effectors and are involved in various events, including cell motility, secretion, alterations in cell morphology, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 4 and 5). These proteins disassemble actin filaments in the presence of micromolar calcium concentrations through their F-actin severing activity. Polyphosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)1 (6), but also lysophosphatidic acid (7), counteract this activity, and uncap gelsolin from barbed actin filaments, making the filaments ends free for polymerization. Gelsolin-related proteins are characterized by repeats of 125-150 amino acid segments. These segments are organized in triplicate, presumably the result of gene multiplication of a prototypical "gelsolin domain" (8, 9). Members of this family typically exist as either three-domain proteins, such as severin from Dictyostelium discoideum (10, 11), fragmins P and A from Physarum (12-16), and CapG (17); or six-domain proteins, such as adseverin (18) and gelsolin (19).

 PUFA Enrichment Displaces Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Proteins but Not PAG/Cbp from Rafts-- Enrichment of Jurkat T cells with PUFAs has been shown to markedly displace the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn from rafts (11). In contrast, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface proteins, exemplified by CD59, remained inside lipid rafts in PUFA-enriched T cells as reported previously and were hence used as raft markers (Fig. 3 and Ref. 11). Targeting to lipid rafts of intracellular proteins such as Src family kinases as well as raft targeting of transmembrane proteins such as LAT appear to be mediated by protein palmitoylation (20, 30, 31). Notably, in PUFA-enriched Jurkat and peripheral blood T cells a considerable fraction of LAT was displaced from lipid rafts in parallel with Src family PTKs (Fig. 3). Because (i) the phosphorylation of LAT was the most upstream signaling event inhibited by PUFA treatment and (ii) LAT was effectively displaced from rafts, the displacement of LAT from lipid rafts could be the primary cause for disturbed signal transduction in PUFA-enriched T cells. Strikingly, another palmitoylated protein, PAG/Cbp (28, 32), was found in lipid rafts irrespective of fatty acid treatment (Fig. 3).

 How may activated caspases translocate to the IMS of the mitochondria? It is still unclear how various procaspases, which generally lack an identifiable mitochondria-targeting sequence (51), get into the IMS. Evidence presented here suggests that a CsA-inhibitable mechanism(s) seems to be responsible, at least partially, for both the early release of the mitochondrial proteins such as cyt. c and Hsp60 as well as for the later translocation of the activated caspases back to the mitochondria. CsA, which has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in multiple model systems, is generally thought to block apoptosis by inhibiting MMP (48, 49). CsA has been shown recently (55) to also inhibit the remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae and consequently inhibit cyt. c release. How mitochondrial proteins are released from the mitochondria is still controversial, but it seems to involve different types of channels consisting of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax and Bak and some resident mitochondrial proteins such as VDAC (reviewed in Refs. 48 and 49). Consistent with our earlier data (30), CsA inhibits the early release of both cyt. c and Hsp60 (Fig. 6), thus suggesting the potential involvement of MMP in this process. Interestingly, CsA also appears to inhibit the later translocation of active caspases as it specifically reduces their levels in the mitochondria (Fig. 6). These results suggest that translocation of the activated caspases back to the mitochondria might use a CsA-sensitive mechanism(s) similar to those utilized for the initial mitochondrial protein release. It is unclear how the activated cytosolic caspase-9, most of which is thought to remain bound to the apoptosome (38-40), gets to the mitochondria. The supramolecular openings formed by Bid, Bax, and the mitochondrial membrane lipids can release molecules of 2,000&nbsp;kDa (56), which should be sufficient to "entertain" the 700-kDa to 1.4-MDa apoptosome. However, Apaf-1 is never detected in the mitochondria. It is possible that some activated caspase-9, especially those activated by caspase-3, may not be apoptosome-bound and thus be free to translocate to the mitochondria.

 Another significant difference between CV-1 cells (Pelkmans et al., 2002) and HuH7, cav-1WT, and cav-1KO cells was the inability of the GTPase-deficient mutant of dynamin II to reduce SV40 endocytosis and infection. One possible reason why dynamin II might be dispensable during SV40 entry into cells devoid of caveolae is that alternative cellular factors are used to form these vesicles. There is already evidence that endocytic pathways do not all rely on dynamin II. The dynamin-independent pathways reported include an ARF6-dependent process that internalizes not only non-raft proteins such as Class I MHC antigens but also some raft-associated proteins such as CD59 from the cell surface to endosomes (Arnaoutova et al., 2003; Naslavsky et al., 2003). The internalization of nonclustered GPI-anchored proteins to endosomes has also been reported to be dynamin II independent, but, in contrast to SV40 endocytosis, it is ARF6 dependent (Sabharanjak et al., 2002; Naslavsky et al., 2004). Moreover, polyomavirus has been reported to enter NIH-3T3 cells by a pathway that is dynamin I, clathrin, and cav-1 independent, but this pathway was not affected by cholesterol depletion (Gilbert and Benjamin, 2000).

 The role of both -catenin and plakoglobin in the assembly of intercellular junctions hinges on their ability to bind to both the cadherin tail and to downstream linking proteins such as -catenin, which couples the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Structural studies of -catenin revealed that the arm repeats are tightly packed and form a superhelix of helices, resulting in a compact structure that forms a binding interface for several interacting partners, including cadherins (48). -Catenin and plakoglobin both bind to the distal region of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail in a highly conserved region termed the catenin binding domain (Fig. 1). Analysis of the cadherin--catenin complex revealed that the cadherin tail is unstructured in the absence of -catenin and is sensitive to proteolytic degradation (49, 50). Whereas the arm domain of -catenin binds to the cadherin tail, the amino-terminal region of -catenin binds to -catenin (2). It is thought that plakoglobin interacts with the cadherin tail and with -catenin in a manner similar to -catenin (97). By interacting with both the cadherin tail and actin binding proteins such as -catenin, -catenin and plakoglobin play key roles in linking the cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton.

 Spermatogenesis is the process of cellular differentiation in which a population of diploid progenitor cells in the testis terminally differentiate into haploid spermatozoa (1). During mammalian spermatogenesis, the genome is repackaged and transcriptionally silenced as histones are replaced with transition proteins and protamines. However, ongoing protein synthesis is required for the extensive differentiation of germ cells into mature gametes. The regulated translation of stored RNAs, therefore, plays a prominent role in the later stages of male germ cell development. A number of paternal mRNAs which are synthesized early in spermiogenesis, e.g., the transition proteins 1 and 2 and the protamines 1 and 2, are stored within the cytoplasm. These RNAs are translationally silent and are present in the non-polysomal messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) fraction presumably in protein-RNA complexes termed mRNP particles or masked mRNAs (2,3). At an appropriate time in development, these stored RNAs become translationally competent. Although proteins such as testis/brain-RNA binding protein (TB-RBP) and protamine binding protein (Prbp) are believed to modulate expression of specific mRNAs encoding proteins such as protamines (4,5), the identity and function of the major proteins in the paternal mRNP masking complexes of mammals is poorly

 Base-substituted analogs of dNTP carrying photoreactive arylazido groups (32) have been utilized previously to design photoreactive DNAs to study the molecular interactions of select base excision repair proteins (33, 34) and to study other proteins such as human replication protein A (35, 36). Similarly, a variety of reactive dNTPs with photoreactive azide functional groups have been surveyed for their ability to cross-link DNA to yeast RNA polymerase in their transcription complexes (37). Phosphorothioester backbone modifications have been utilized to successfully couple an azidophenacyl moiety to oligonucleotides and cross-link proteins such as integration host factor and transcription factor IIIB to DNA (26, 38). By incorporating both photoreactive azide-containing dNTPs and the azidophenacyl cross-linking moieties into oligonucleotides in this study, we sought to gain new insight into the interaction of UvrA and UvrB with damaged DNA. We have included a graphic representation of our modified DNA substrates super-imposed on the crystal structure of B. caldotenax UvrB Y96A, Fig. 3E, (10, 15). As stated above, we have strategically designed our substrates to contain a cross-linking probe on either the damaged or non-damaged strand (XL126 and XL225 or S-1AZ/F26) of the DNA.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES &nbsp; LRP-1 gene disruption in the mouse is embryonic lethal (36); however, in cell culture model systems, LRP-1 regulates cell signaling and cell physiology by diverse mechanisms. A unique property of LRP-1 is its ability to facilitate endocytosis of other plasma membrane proteins, including uPAR, APP, and tissue factor, and thereby down-regulate cell surface levels of these proteins (21&#150;25). This process probably requires bifunctional ligands or adaptor proteins, such as Fe65, that bridge LRP-1 to other plasma membrane proteins so that the complexes undergo endocytosis as units (18, 21, 37). By decreasing the level of uPAR, LRP-1 indirectly controls cell signaling pathways leading to the activation of Ras, ERK/MAPK, and Rac1 (23, 26). In mice, inactivation of the LRP-1 gene in vascular smooth muscle cells increases cellular levels of PDGF receptor and its degree of tyrosine phosphorylation (38). Thus, there is evidence that LRP-1 controls the activity of cell signaling receptors in vivo. LRP-1 may also directly regulate cell signaling through interactions involving its intracytoplasmic tail and proteins such as Shc, Disabled-1, and JNK-interacting protein (37, 39, 40).

 Infection, inflammation, and trauma induce a wide range of metabolic changes in the liver as part of APR and result in the altered concentration of plasma proteins that are collectively called acute phase proteins (1, 37). During the APR, the levels of proteins such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A increase (positive acute phase proteins), whereas the levels of proteins such as albumin and transferrin decrease (negative acute phase proteins) (1, 37, 38). It is believed that positive acute phase proteins play a role in protecting the host by neutralizing foreign agents to minimize tissue damage (39). Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 mediate the APR and the transcriptional regulation of positive and negative acute phase proteins. Activation of the TNF/IL-1 receptors stimulates membrane sphingomyelinase to convert sphingomyelin to ceramide, which leads to the activation and translocation of transcription factors activator protein-1 and nuclear factor B and induces class I acute phase proteins (40, 41). On the other hand, activation of the IL-6 receptor activates Janus tyrosine kinase and subsequently phosphorylates tyrosine residue of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins, inducing transcription of class II proteins (41, 42).

 The activity of Bax in the mitochondria is thought to involve the opening of the MPT pore, a multiprotein complex located at the contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. This complex is composed of cytosolic proteins, such as hexokinase; outer membrane proteins, such as the benzodiazepin receptor and the voltage-dependent anion channel; an intermembrane protein creatine kinase; an inner membrane protein, the adenine nucleotide translocator; and at least one matrix protein, cyclophilin D (52-54). Under normal circumstances, the inner mitochondrial membrane is nearly impermeable. This feature is required for maintaining the H+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane or the inner transmembrane potential, m. The MPT involves the opening of a large channel (~2.9 nm, ~1.3 nS), allowing the diffusion of solutes with a molecular mass of &lt;1.5 kDa causing the dissipation of m (55, 56). This is associated with the release of Ca2+ and glutathione from the mitochondrial matrix, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation with cessation of ATP synthesis, inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, inhibition of protein import into the mitochondria, and hyperproduction of ROS by the uncoupled respiratory chain. These changes occur almost universally during the apoptotic process (42).

 Critical molecules participating in the transduction of proliferative signals have just begun to be identified. One such example is the family of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) ()or MAP kinases(7) . The enzymatic activity of these kinases increases in response to most mitogens, such as those acting on receptor-protein tyrosine kinases or on receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins)(3, 4, 7) . Activation of the tyrosine kinase class of receptors transmits signals to MAP kinases in a multistep process. For the EGF receptor, essential components of this process include the adaptor protein GRB2/SEM-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein such as SOS, p21, and a cascade of protein kinases defined sequentially as MAP kinase kinase kinase, represented by c-Raf-1 and MEKK, and MAP kinase kinase, such as MEK1 and MEK2(7, 8, 9) . MEKs ultimately phosphorylate MAP kinases in both threonine and tyrosine residues, thereby increasing their enzymatic activity(7, 8, 9) . In turn, MAP kinases phosphorylate and regulate the activity of key enzymes including the EGF receptor, phospholipase A, p90, and nuclear proteins such as c-Myc and p62 Elk1(10) , which ultimately regulate the expression of genes essential for

 survival &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Patients and methods Results Discussion References &nbsp; Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) represent 30% to 40% of adult non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphomas (NHL) [1]. This lymphoma entity, as defined in the Revised European&#150;American Lymphoma (REAL) [1] and WHO classifications [2], has been recognized from the start as relatively heterogeneous regarding histological subtypes, genetic alterations and clinical evolution. At the present time, patient outcome prediction and treatment strategies rely on the International Pronostic Index (IPI) [3], which identifies four different patient risk subgroups. This predictive model is based on clinical characteristics that are supposed to reflect the tumor&#146;s growth and invasive potential, and the patient&#146;s response to the tumor and ability to tolerate intensive therapy [4]. However, IPI subgroups remain heterogeneous and molecular markers could help to identify within these subgroups those patients who will do well, and those who will relapse, so that treatment strategies can be better tailored. Indeed, several studies have correlated the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl2 [5] or survivin [6], or adhesive proteins such as CD44 [7], to clinical course and shown that these factors add substantial prognostic information to the IPI score.

 Most C2 domain proteins are either signal transduction enzymes, such as protein kinase C, or membrane trafficking proteins, such as synaptotagmin 1. At least some isoforms of all major signal transduction enzymes, from ubiquitin ligases to kinases to various phospholipases, contain a C2 domain. Without exception, these proteins are soluble cytosolic enzymes that include a single C2 domain. In contrast, membrane trafficking proteins generally include at least two C2 domains, although a few proteins such as the -RIM isoforms (9) and some splice variants of piccolo/aczonin and intersectin (10-12) contain only a single C2 domain. In membrane trafficking proteins the different C2 domains often feature conserved sequence differences, indicating that the C2 domains are functionally specialized. For example, although in synaptotagmin 1 the C2A and C2B domains both bind Ca2+ and phospholipids with similar affinities (13), the C2B domain contains an additional "bottom" -helix that is absent from the C2A domain but is conserved in all of the C2B domains of synaptotagmins (14). Membrane trafficking proteins with multiple C2 domains either have no TMR1 or a single TMR either at the N terminus (e.g. synaptotagmins; see Fig. 1) (15) or the C terminus (e.g. ferlins) (16).

 The mechanisms underlying Fas-mediated chemokine production still need to be fully elucidated. Our data demonstrate that activation of ERK1/2 and caspases is necessary for Fas-induced chemokine production in DCs, whereas activation of NF-B and p38 (data not shown) and secretion of IL-1 are not involved. MAPKs are serine-threonine kinases activated by diverse stimuli, and the components include ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein pathways.41 Combining with our previous study, we demonstrated activation of ERK1/2 determined Fas-induced cytokine and chemokine secretion.18 However, we did not detect p38 activation, despite a report that this molecule is activated following Fas ligation in glioma cells. Some small G proteins such as Rac-1 and Ras have been reported to participate in Fas-induced apoptosis,24,25 Our data demonstrate that Fas signaling could activate membrane-bound small G protein such as ras and raf to ultimately activate ERK1/2 pathways, resulting in DC chemokine production. Because inhibition of Ras and Raf-1 partially abrogates Fas-ligation&#150;induced chemokine production, we speculate that an alternative pathway might exist in Fas-ligation&#150;induced activation of MEK and ERK1/2.

 Many membrane proteins cycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles. Examples include receptor proteins such as the transferrin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptors and transporting proteins such as the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter GLUT-4, the Na+-pumping Na+-K+-ATPase, the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, and, in some cells, CFTR. Extensive studies have shown that, for many of the recycling membrane proteins, one or more steps in the recycling pathway is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, is a potent inhibitor of PI3K activity [inhibitor constant (Ki)&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;nM], and it blocks the movement of many membrane proteins at some point in the endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling pathway (31, 36, 38). One effect of wortmannin is to reduce the plasma membrane content of recycling proteins by trapping them in an endosomal compartment. For instance, wortmannin blocks exocytosis of GLUT-4 without affecting its endocytosis (13). Similarly, wortmannin inhibits exocytic recycling of transferrin receptors while at the same time increasing the rate of endocytosis (37). The net effect is a reduction in the steady-state level of plasma membrane transferrin receptors. Additionally, wortmannin causes accumulation of NHE3 in an endosomal compartment in NHE3-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (27). Reports from a number of cell systems suggest that wortmannin inhibits trafficking within the endosomal system at multiple steps. In mouse L cells, wortmannin has no effect on the internalization of the Man-6-P receptor or its ligand, -glucuronidase. However, wortmannin inhibits recycling of the Man-6- P receptor back to the trans-Golgi network as well as -glucuronidase delivery to lysosomes (25). Thus, while there may be multiple steps in vesicular trafficking sensitive to wortmannin, a common observation is wortmannin inhibition of trafficking out of the endosomal compartment (34). Finally, it is important to keep in mind that wortmannin has additional affects on vesicular trafficking beyond inhibition of postendosomal sorting and recycling. Wortmannin is reported to inhibit the endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins such as Na+-K+-ATPase -subunits in dopamine-stimulated renal proximal tubules (12).

 It is known that several heat shock proteins (HSPs) such as HSP90, HSP70, HSP47, and HSP20 are induced by heat in the embryo (reviewed by Graham et al., 1998). HSPs are classically thought to be cellular protective agents in living organisms (Craig et al., 1994), and a few studies have suggested that HSPs might play a protective role in heat-induced teratogenesis (Kapron-Bras and Hales, 1991; Mirkes, 1987, 1997; Walsh et al., 1987). HSP90 is a molecular chaperone that binds with and/or forms multiprotein complexes with substrate proteins such as protein kinases and transcription factors, thus regulating their function (Richter and Buchner, 2001). Several studies have shown that HSP90 exists in two isoforms, HSP90 and &#223;, which play an important role in the regulation of an ever-increasing list of transcription factors and protein kinases (Moore et al., 1989; Pratt, 1998; Rebbe et al., 1989); however, their role in heat-induced teratogenesis is not clear. HSP90 has been shown to be heat-inducible in the zebrafish embryo while HSP90&#223; is not (Krone and Sass, 1994), and HSP90 is known to associate with b-helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as myoD that are crucial in development (Sass and Krone, 1997).

 MTs comprise one of the major cytoskeletal systems of the cell and play an essential role in cytoplasmic organization and cell division. MTs interact with a variety of proteins, including the kinesins, a group of plus- and minus-end&#150;directed motor proteins that travel along MTs to accomplish intracellular transport (Titus and Gilbert 1999 ). MTs either can be stable structures, as in ciliary axonemes, or dynamic ones, as in mitotic spindles, where they alternately undergo growth and shrinkage. This dynamic instability is regulated by several proteins that either stabilize MTs or induce their disassembly. The stabilization of MTs is affected by a variety of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as MAP2 and MAP4 (Drewes et al. 1999 ). Conversely, the destabilization of MTs is caused by proteins such as the katanins, which break MTs internally to initiate disassembly (Hartman and Vale 1999 ), or by proteins that catalyze end-based disassembly either from one end, such as Stathmin/Oncoprotein 18 (Wallon et al. 2000 ), or from both ends, such as XKCM1 and XKIF2 (Desai et al. 1999 ). Together, these proteins regulate MT dynamics, and, as illustrated by the antagonistic activities of XKCM1 and XMAP215, may act as regulatory pairs (Tournebize et al. 2000 ).

 Mechanisms of tight junction resealing following ischemia have not been fully characterized. First, it is likely that tight junctions have to reassemble following ischemic injury, since ischemia or associated ATP depletion disrupts tight junction integrity (16, 17). Reassembly of tight junctions following events such as ATP depletion involves localization of integral membrane proteins such as occludin to the apical-most aspect of the lateral epithelial membrane, along with colocalization of cytoplasmic proteins such as ZO-1 (28). Similarly, studies utilizing a calcium switch (chelation and subsequent repletion of calcium) to disrupt and allow recovery of tight junctions documented the critical role of integral membrane proteins in orchestrating reassembly of tight junctions (22). Although we do not know if these same mechanisms are responsible for PG-stimulated recovery of TER, we do have evidence on immunofluorescence that PGs restore the distribution of the tight junction integral membrane protein occludin and the cytoplasmic plaque protein ZO-1 to the region of the interepithelial junction. However, there was no difference in the expression of occludin in response to PG treatment, suggesting that PGs stimulate movement of preexisting occludin and ZO-1 dispersed throughout the cell during ischemic injury to the interepithelial junction during recovery.

 One approach for exploring how human oocytes regulate homologue disjunction would be to apply RNAi to genes shown to be required for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis I in other species. One such group of genes encodes for proteins of the spindle checkpoint surveillance system. The spindle checkpoint has long been known to be essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (see for review, Mussachio and Hardwick, 2002). More recently, the spindle checkpoint has also been shown to be essential for the fidelity of homologue disjunction in a variety of species including yeast (Shonn et al., 2000; Bernard et al., 2001), zebrafish (Poss et al., 2004) and mouse oocytes (Homer et al., 2005). This checkpoint is comprised primarily of the mitotic arrest deficient (Mad) and the budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (Bub) protein families (Mussachio and Hardwick, 2002). In the presence of misaligned chromosomes, checkpoint proteins such as Mad2 and BubR1 (the vertebrate homologue of yeast Mad3) prevent anaphase by inhibiting a multi-subunit protein complex called the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Peters, 2002). Following proper chromosome alignment, checkpoint-induced inhibition is relieved and APC/C-mediated destruction of key proteins such as securin and cyclin B1 initiate anaphase (Peters, 2002).

 The expression of CD16B and CD32A on neutrophils from donor 17&nbsp;were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1, a CD16-specific mAb, CLBFcgran-1 did not bind to neutrophils from a blood donor (donor 17,&nbsp;or D17). In addition, anti-CD16 mAbs 3G8, CLBFcgran-11, and GRM1 also did not bind to neutrophils from the same donor (data not shown). However, the expression of CD32A on neutrophils was similar to that observed in neutrophils from the control donor (Figure 1). CD16B is expressed as a GPI-anchored form on neutrophils. Because the cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins such as CD16B, CD55, and CD59 is defective in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria27 because of a defect in the biosynthesis of the GPI-anchor, the expression of other GPI-anchored proteins was analyzed. The expression of CD55 and CD59 in neutrophils from D17 were normal (data not shown), indicating that the deficient CD16B expression in D17 was not caused by paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Neither control nor D17 neutrophils expressed CD64. The expression of other cell surface proteins, such as LFA-3, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CR1, and HLA class I, was not altered in neutrophils from D17 (data not shown).

The most acidic protein identified was the msyB gene product (pI 3.42), while the most basic was the rpmH gene product (pI 13.1). The smallest protein identified was the product of rpsV (Mr = 5.1 kDa), and the largest was the product of b2520 (Mr = 182 kDa). A 2D visualization of the pI and Mr of the 1,480 proteins and the E. coli proteome predicted from the ORFs (Fig. 2) suggests that our analysis covered &gt; 99% of the bacterial proteome (with respect to Mr and pI).

Thus, the analysis appears to have covered E. coli proteins whose cellular abundance range from 100 to 100,000 copies per cell (Table I).

 The role of integrins as mechanosignaling molecules for cell adhesion has been established. Signals from extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin and fibronectin are transmitted through integrin complexes to intracellular proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase (Howe et al., 2002; Schwartz, 2001). Like the integrins, the sarcoglycan complex may participate in both mechanical and signaling roles at the plasma membrane. Supporting this, the cytoplasmic tails of - and -sarcoglycan have conserved tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domains of - and -sarcoglycan bind filamin C (Thompson et al., 2000). In other tissues, filamins have been shown to interact with integrin subunits, specifically to the &#223;1 subunit of integrin. Thus, filamin may be one of the signaling mechanisms onto which both integrins and sarcoglycans converge. The synthetic lethal phenotype produced by the combined sarcoglycan and integrin loss from the surface of myofibers highlights not only the downstream signaling mechanisms that may function in parallel between these two cellular attachments, but also emphasizes the extracellular component, laminin, with which each of these complexes interacts. These findings help elucidate the role of the sarcoglycan complex, drawing parallels to the integrin complex, in its role in cytoskeletal-membrane-matrix interactions.

 Metabolism of phosphoinositides can also influence nuclear accumulation of other PI-binding proteins, such as ING2 and Tub. Recent work demonstrates that overexpression of PIKII decreases nuclear PI(5)P by converting it to PIP2, thereby decreasing nuclear accumulation of ING2 (27). ING2 is a protein that copurifies with components important to chromatin remodeling (55), is up-regulated in response to DNA damage (56), and is thought to be important for apoptosis (27). On the other hand, Tub is bound to PIP2 in the plasma membrane via its tubby domain; upon PLC-mediated hydrolysis of this pool of PIP2, Tub is released and translocates to the nucleus (26). Although it has not been reported that Tub interacts with nuclear PIP2, a potential mechanism to target specific subcompartments within the nucleus may involve its tubby domain. Thus, a rise in the ratio of nuclear to extranuclear polyphosphoinositides could cause the accumulation of various regulatory proteins in the nucleus. Recruitment of polyphosphoinositide-binding proteins such as PLC might influence gene regulation, mRNA processing, and DNA synthesis by modulating the levels of lipids and generating local second messengers; This could provide a simple mechanism to coordinate nuclear activities with cell surface events linked to polyphosphoinositide metabolism.

 It remains to be determined just how intragranular protein complexes are formed at the TGN and SGs. We believe that at least two SGM-binding proteins, CPE and SgIII, serve as an adapter function for intragranular complex formation via specific lipid binding. Since CPE has been proposed to be a sorting receptor for POMC (10), a number of studies have presented data both for and against a sorting receptor function of CPE. The sorting of proinsulin was not impaired in CPE-deficient Cpefat/Cpefat mice (42, 43), whereas CPE was shown to co-aggregate with POMC, prolactin, and insulin at an acidic pH in vitro (44). Although CPE plays an essential role in sorting for a limited number of prohormones, it is not a universal sorting receptor. This is also true for the sorting role of SgIII. SgIII anchors CgA to the SGM, and CgA multimers condense prohormones and SG-associated proteins in the intragranular complex by co-aggregation. Thus, we believe that SG formation depends on at least three mechanisms: 1) specific lipid binding of adapter proteins such as CPE and SgIII, 2) a specific protein-protein interaction such as SgIII and CgA, and 3) the aggregation property of granins and CPE.

 Integrins are noncovalent heterodimers of type I transmembrane protein subunits termed &nbsp;and . Each subunit has a large (&gt;700 residues) N-terminal extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a generally short (13-70 residues) cytoplasmic domain (5). In general, integrin &nbsp;and &nbsp;subunits contain a remarkably conserved 7-10-residue motif near the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (membrane-proximal segment) (6). The remainders of the cytoplasmic domain sequences are generally less well conserved. Integrin &nbsp;cytoplasmic domains are required for activation because mutations or truncations of specific membrane-distal sequences in &nbsp;cytoplasmic tails can disrupt activation (7-10). A particularly sensitive site is a highly conserved NPX(Y/F) motif in the &nbsp;cytoplasmic domain where substitution of the Tyr with Ala (e.g. 3(Y747A)) blocks activation (11). This region of the &nbsp;tail is important for binding to cytoskeletal proteins, such as talin because a Tyr &nbsp;Ala substitution in the NPX(Y/F) motif also disrupts talin binding to &nbsp;tails in vitro (12, 13). Moreover, overexpression of an integrin-binding fragment of talin in cells activates integrin IIb3 (14). Thus, interactions of membrane distal portions of the &nbsp;cytoplasmic domain with proteins such as talin appear to be important in integrin activation.

 Coactivators and corepressors modulate nuclear receptor activity. Although little data are available for negative TREs, on positive TREs it is known that unliganded TRs interact with corepressor proteins such as nuclear corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) mediating ligand-independent repression (47, 48, 49, 50). Ligand binding releases corepressor proteins from TRs (43, 45) and recruits coactivator proteins such as the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) (for review, see Ref. 35), switching transcription of positively regulated genes from repressive states to active states. As we have recently shown low levels of expression of NCoR and SMRT mRNA in the PVN (37), we concentrated on potential differential interactions of TR1 and TR&#223;1 on site 4 with a typical coactivator (SRC-1), which is highly expressed in the PVN (36). Our data show both TRs had similar binding profiles, interacting with SRC-1 in the presence, but not in the absence, of T3. Other authors (44, 51) observed a shift on the TRH promoter in the presence of TR&#223;1 with NCoR and SMRT on site 4. These data indicate that TR-comodulator interactions are similarly modulated by T3, whether on a positive or on a negative TRE.

 In general, signaling proteins such as tyrosine kinase receptors are expressed at low levels of several hundred or thousand molecules per cell. Assuming that a crude protein extract from 106 cells is applied to an array in a volume of 1 ml, limits of detection of between 1 pg/ml and 100 pg/ml are theoretically required for the detection of these low-abundance proteins. As outlined above, comparable sensitivities have been achieved by different antibody-based microarray formats, suggesting that low-abundance proteins such as phosphorylated signaling proteins might be detectable by SH2-based microarray formats. The discrepancy between our observations and antibody-based microarrays may be explained by differences in the binding affinities of antibodies and SH2 domains. While the Kd for antigen-antibody reactions is typically below 1 nM, interactions of SH2 domains with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are significantly weaker, with affinities in the range of 100 nM to 1 &#181;M (15, 86). Specific binding is further compromised by poor kinetics. Because the rate of binding is proportional to the on-rate and the concentration of analyte, relatively modest on-rates and low analyte concentrations necessarily imply that specific binding will be relatively slow, while nonspecific binding may be more rapid.

 Muscle &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References &nbsp; Integrins are heterodimeric &#223; transmembrane proteins that bind extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as laminin and fibronectin as well as cytoskeletal proteins such as talin and filamin (Hynes, 1992). Integrins serve in a mechanosignaling capacity allowing integrin to conduct both inside-out as well as outside-in signaling. In skeletal muscle, integrin 7&#223;1 serves as the major laminin-binding integrin. Mice deficient for integrin &#223;1 die early in development, but integrin &#223;1-deficient cells can effectively contribute to developing muscle (Fassler and Meyer, 1995; Hirsch et al., 1998). Integrin 7 is expressed highly in cardiac and skeletal muscle where it binds the 2 chain of laminin-2 in the extracellular matrix (von der Mark et al., 1991). In humans, mutations in the integrin 7 gene lead to congenital muscular dystrophy (Hayashi et al., 1998). Gene targeting of the murine integrin 7 gene produces a mild, progressive muscular dystrophy characterized by comparatively little muscle degeneration and regeneration (Mayer et al., 1997). The interaction of integrin 7&#223;1 with laminin-2 (merosin) appears to be a specialized mechanosignaling transducer essential for the maintenance of mature skeletal muscle (Mayer et al., 1997; Vachon et al., 1997).

 VV expresses many proteins that are non-essential for virus replication in cell culture but which contribute to virus virulence in vivo and several proteins of this group function as immunomodulators to affect the host response to infection. VV immunomodulators may be grouped according to their site of action. Those proteins secreted from the infected cell usually bind to and inhibit the function of host proteins such as interferons, cytokines, chemokines or complement, whereas intracellular proteins may interfere with interferon-induced antiviral proteins, cell signalling pathways or apoptosis. The correct location of the protein is essential to mediate these different functions. In several cases the function of VV immunomodulatory proteins has been inferred from computational analyses of amino acid sequences that revealed similarities between a VV protein and a host protein of known function. In other cases, the function of a virus protein has been deduced by functional studies. In the case of N1L, although bioinformatic analyses established that the protein is conserved in several orthopoxviruses and in other chordopoxvirus genera, no amino acid similarity with host proteins was detected. Predictions of the secondary structure of N1L showed a largely alpha-helical protein that has a similar overall topology to other small alpha-helical proteins such as IL-10 and interferon-. This similarity, taken together with the proposed secreted nature of N1L, led this protein to be described by some as a virokine (Chang et al., 1992 ) and suggested a possible mechanism by which N1L contributed to virulence. However, data presented here cause the mechanism of action of N1L to be reconsidered. Computational analyses suggest that N1L is also related structurally to intracellular alpha-helical proteins such as the N-terminal actin-cross-linking domain of fimbrin (pdb 1aoa), histone acetyltransferase bromodomain (pdb 1b91) and the N-terminal domain of transcription elongation factor TFIIS (pdb 1eo0). It remains possible that the small fraction of N1L that is released from cells mediates an important extracellular function; however, it is more likely that the site of action of N1L is intracellular where the majority of the protein is located. Determination of the mechanism of action of N1L requires additional study.

However, it is conceivable that additional treatment strategies may be developed that block pathophysiological, further downstream events, namely the interaction of ultrafiltered proteins with tubular cells and their activation.

 Proteinase&#150;adhesin complexes, encoded by rgpA and kgp, appear to bind several human proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin and laminin (Pike et al., 1996). Since these complexes are on the cell surface (Bhogal et al., 1997; DeCarlo &amp; Harber, 1997), they may play important roles in the attachment of Por. gingivalis to host-cell surfaces. HRgp, which consists of an Rgp domain and HGP44 (Pike et al., 1994; Curtis et al., 1999), actually adheres to erythrocytes and platelets, resulting in haemagglutination and platelet aggregation, respectively (Pike et al., 1994; Shibata et al., 1999; Lourbakos et al., 2001). In this study, we demonstrated that HGP17 and HGP44 of the proteinase&#150;adhesin complexes play an important role in Por. gingivalis vesicle-mediated aggregation of Pre. intermedia. This finding provides a novel function of the adhesin domains with regard to Por. gingivalis adherence. Interactions of various micro-organisms in the periodontal region result in a complex bacterial network in the gingival biofilm, which is believed to cause periodontal diseases. The adhesin domain proteins, such as HGP17 and HGP44, may make a significant contribution to the formation of the complex bacterial network as well as to the adhesion of Por. gingivalis to the cells of several different species of bacteria.

 Second, recruitment of HDAC complex to promoters has emerged as a general mechanism of transcription repression of target genes, and it may be mediated either through direct interactions with regulatory proteins such as transcription factor or through interaction with corepressors containing an HDAC-interacting domain. One possible mechanism to explain how Smad3/Smad4 can modulate AR transactivation is that after interaction with AR, the complex of Smad3/Smad4 may be able to recruit some transcriptional repressors associated with the HDAC complex, which may then result in the repression of AR transactivation via decreasing the acetylation level of AR. HDAC1 is found in a large transcriptional regulatory complex that includes AR, Smad3, Sin3A (34), and N-CoR (36, 39), and the p300 coactivator may compete with some HDAC1-associated proteins, such as c-ski or TGIF, for the binding to the MH2 domain of Smad3 (43, 44). Moreover, because TGIF has been demonstrated to interact with AR and Smad proteins (36, 43), it will be of interest to test whether HDAC1 was recruited into the Smad3/Smad4 complex on the AR-mediated PSA promoter and HDAC1 or whether TGIF has any influence on the Smad3/Smad4-mediated repression of AR transactivation in the prostate cancer cells.

 The intracellular localization of BH3-only proteins such as Bad is regulated by phosphorylation, with serine/threonine phosphorylation leading to cytosolic sequestration with proteins such as 14-3-3.17,18 To determine whether PDE4 inhibitor treatment altered phosphorylation of Bad at sites previously known to negatively regulate its apoptotic activity, we examined Bad phosphorylation with phospho-specific antibodies to Bad. In leukemic cells from 3&nbsp;of the 5&nbsp;CLL patients examined, rolipram treatment reduced Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 while no consistent effect was identified for Ser136 and Ser155 (Figure 5C and data not shown). Among these patients, total levels of Bad modestly declined (Figures 5C and 7C) at this time point. Bad is known to associate with 14-3-3,&nbsp;an association that may regulate the sensitivity of Bad to phosphatases.19 In those leukemic cell samples in which rolipram/forskolin treatment induced Bad Ser112 dephosphorylation, immunoprecipitation of Bad from CLL cells cultured for 18&nbsp;hours with 10&nbsp;&#181;M rolipram and 40&nbsp;&#181;M forskolin revealed less associated 14-3-3&nbsp;protein than in control cells cultured in media alone (Figure 5C). These studies suggest that rolipram/forskolin treatment of CLL cells can reduce association of Bad with 14-3-3&nbsp;and induce Bad Ser112 dephosphorylation.

 The YXXXK motif is too degenerate to be used in data mining. We searched data bases with a more stringent pattern (LI)(LV)X8YX3K in which the double hydrophobic residues help to anchor the motif near the membrane (see Fig. 1). This pattern is still not very stringent, but we identified the motif in several membrane proteins, usually at the interface between a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region. Most interesting, in the three 2-adrenergic receptors, this pattern is found in the proximal region of their third intracellular loop where basolateral trafficking and stabilization signals have been located. The pattern is also present in intracellular regions of other G protein-coupled receptors such as the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine, type 4 receptor, the cannabinoid CB1, or the chemokine CCR7 receptors. The pattern is also found in other membrane proteins such as the sodium channel subunit SCN8, chloride channels CLC3-5, single transmembrane domain proteins such as neuronal cell adhesion molecule or atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor IB, as well as different kinds of transporters. The presence of the pattern in the third loop of 2-adrenergic receptors suggests that it might represent a protein-protein interaction domain involved in stabilization of the subset of membrane proteins.

It is indeed suspected that free oligomannosides would otherwise compete for oligomannoside recognizing proteins such as glycosidases, chaperones, and glycosyltransferases. In addition, free oligomannosides would follow the secretory pathway and interfere with the Golgi processing machinery.

 It is intriguing to speculate that there may be a population of cells, present at airway bifurcations, that function as sentinel cells for pulmonary injury. Airway bifurcations, as well as terminal bronchioles, represent potential foci for cytotoxicity from inhaled air pollutants (11). Cells at airway bifurcations could be regulated by the response of the sensitive, sentinel, cell. The bifurcation cells could be warned early in the injury process of the need to become resistant to pulmonary toxicants. Perhaps by upregulating certain tissue proteins (such as heat shock proteins) or by downregulating or decreasing expression of other proteins (such as CYP2F2), cells at bifurcations could modulate their responses. There is some support for survival of a resistant population in the pulmonary literature. Other researchers have reported that there is a population of Clara cells present at airway bifurcations in male (28) and female (31) mice that are "pollutant resistant." Because the earliest time point examined was 6&nbsp;h and the methods of injury detection did not look at the airway in three dimensions, they may have overlooked a small number of transiently present cytotoxic sentinel cells. Further studies are needed to address whether the permeable cells present at airway bifurcations are Clara cells or some other cell type.

 The stabilization of ERK7 by expression of dominant-negative Cullin-1 suggests that the proteolytic recognition complex is an SCF complex. SCF is one of the best characterized ubiquitin ligase complexes and consists of a number of subunits including Cullin-1. Functioning as a scaffold protein, Cullin family proteins bind both to the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and Roc 1, a RING finger protein that binds to the ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme (14). The N terminus of Cullin-1 interacts with the adapter protein Skp1, which complexes to a number of different F-box proteins such as Skp2 to assemble different SCF-Roc1 E3 ligases. The E3 ligase complexes then recruit and ubiquitinate specific substrates including many nuclear cell cycle regulatory proteins such as p27 (15) and p21 (16, 17). The dominant-negative Cullin-1 that we used to stabilize ERK7 expression lacks the C terminus that interacts with the Roc1 protein, and thus does not ubiquitinate its substrates (11). The result we obtained suggests that ERK7 is ubiquitinated by an SCF E3 ligase, but does not identify a specific recognition protein. Because ERK7 is localized in the nucleus and can inhibit DNA synthesis (2), proteolytic regulation similar to that of cell cycle proteins would not be surprising.

 BMP is an important molecule in the body in various aspects. BMP is required for the maintenance of bone to support the body or to protect internal organs. BMP also regulates morphogenesis during embryonic development. In accordance with such a variety of BMP actions, numerous groups of BMP inhibitors have been identified. One group includes soluble BMP inhibitors such as noggin, chordin, SOST, and gremlin, which act outside the cells. These molecules inhibit BMP signaling via binding to BMP ligands to prevent their binding to their cognate receptors (27&#150;29). BMP3 binds to BMP receptor and inhibits bone formation. Other groups consist of inhibitory Smad proteins, such as Smad6 and Smad7. These negative Smads inhibit intracellular BMP signaling by binding to BMP receptors or regulatory Smads (30, 31). A recently identified group contains proteins such as Tob, which acts as a Smad repressor to inhibit BMP signaling at the level of the nuclear transport or transcription (31). CIZ is special and distinct from other proteins because it localizes at adhesion plaques and simultaneously activates gene expression in addition to Smad modulation (19). It is also unique in terms of its localization at nuclear matrix (15). Thus, CIZ should be considered as a unique class of BMP inhibitor in vivo.

Sandoval et al.(40) have demonstrated that a critical LI motif within the cytoplasmic tail of the lysosomal protein, LIMP II, is held in an extended configuration and does not adopt a -turn. Thus it remains to be determined whether the basolateral sorting cellular machinery which recognizes -turn motifs could also interact with di-hydrophobic motifs, such as those found in FcRII-B2 and CD44. The second issue raised from these studies is how the cellular machinery distinguishes between basolaterally sorted proteins such as FcRII-B2 that are readily endocytosed and those such as CD44 that remain as resident plasma membrane proteins. In this respect, studies on the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein are of interest. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein utilizes a classic Y-X-X-aliphatic motif, YTDI, to mediate its basolateral sorting in MDCK cells, but this glycoprotein remains expressed at the plasma membrane and is not endocytosed(41, 42) . If common machinery is used for basolateral sorting, then resident basolateral proteins such as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and CD44 must either be missing additional components necessary for efficient endocytosis and/or be subject to retention mechanisms that would prevent recruitment into the coated

 Regardless of an organism's complexity, its ability to adapt to changes in environmental oxygen tension is critical to its survival. In many circumstances, the adaptive response to low oxygen tension requires alterations in the expression of specific genes. In mammals, genes encoding proteins such as erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor, critical molecules in system-wide functions such as erythropoiesis and blood vessel formation, respectively, were among the first shown to be regulated by hypoxia (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). The regulation of these genes by hypoxia has served as a paradigm for the subsequent identification of hypoxia-regulated genes involved in basic intracellular metabolic and biochemical pathways. For example, the hypoxia responsiveness of genes involved in sugar transport (e.g. GLUT1 and GLUT3) and energy production (e.g. genes encoding certain glycolytic enzymes) is mediated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),1 the same transcription factor that plays a critical role in erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor activation in response to low oxygen tension (3, 4). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein comprised of an &nbsp;and &nbsp;subunit, both of which are basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the PAS family of transcription factors. The previously identified &nbsp;subunit is ARNT, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. ARNT mRNA and protein levels are not significantly affected by ambient oxygen tension. In contrast, although HIF-1 mRNA levels are not appreciably affected by oxygen tension, HIF-1 protein is only minimally present in normoxia, being rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in this condition. However, HIF-1 accumulates in response to hypoxia, certain transition metals (e.g. cobalt and nickel), and iron chelators such as desferrioxamine. Once the heterodimer is formed under these conditions, it can interact with other DNA-binding proteins (such as HNF4) which function in part to provide tissue and developmental specificity (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). HIF-1 has also been shown to associate with scaffold proteins such as p300/CBP (5), which have been shown to interact with the basal transcription machinery (6, 7). The interactions between the proteins in this complex have been the focus of several investigators, and have been reviewed previously (reviewed in Ref. 2).

 Several mechanisms of CaMKII subcellular targeting have been characterized as CaMKII splice variants and isoforms can contain targeting sequences such as a nuclear localization sequence and actin binding domains (8, 9). Membrane targeting can be mediated by assembly with proteins such as CaMKII association protein (10). Recently, CaMKII has shown calcium/calmodulin-dependent interactions with membrane proteins such as the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2B) that can affect its distribution in heterologous cells (11, 12). Activity-dependent CaMKII translocation in neurons has also been observed. Synaptic calcium influx through NMDA receptors in cultured, dissociated neurons and in vivo can cause rapid accumulation of CaMKII in post-synaptic sites (13, 14). Furthermore, induction of long term potentiation results in increased post-synaptic density (PSD) association of autophosphorylated CaMKII that displays calcium-independent activity (15). Disruptions in the synaptic localization of CaMKII have been correlated with behavioral defects in transgenic mice carrying mutated CaMKII or lacking local CaMKII synthesis in dendrites (16, 17). A synaptic localization and function is supported by the finding of 28 CaMKII substrates in the PSD, including receptors, cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, and scaffolds (18) and is consistent with CaMKII regulation of cellular processes such as dendritic spine remodeling and AMPAR exocytosis that span several subcellular compartments (19, 20).

 What physiological roles might there be for interaction between PSD-95 and Kv4.2? An obvious role is to establish or maintain specialized channel distributions. In supraoptic neurons, Kv4.2 is clustered at the post-synaptic membrane (47), particularly at sites of synaptic contact, and in hippocampal neurons, where Kv4.2 is also present (3, 4, 18), PSD-95 is only present in post-synaptic regions (48). Because Kv4.2 is somatodendritic and we found that clustering of Kv4.2 was induced by PSD-95 in transfected cells, it might also do so at the post-synaptic membrane. PSD-95 clusters other proteins, including NMDA receptors (49) and Sema4C (50) in native tissues, and NMDA receptors (49, 51), Kir2.1 (52), Kir2.3 (52), and Kv1 channels (12) in heterologous expression systems. The diverse types and distribution patterns of proposed binding partners have been puzzling because PSD-95 was previously thought to be concentrated at post-synaptic sites. However, a recent examination of PSD-95 distribution using electron microscopy revealed a surprisingly high amount in non-synaptic sites, for instance in axons (53). Thus, in principle, PSD-95 might interact in vivo with both somatodendritically located proteins, such as Kv4.2, and axonally located proteins, such as some Kv1 channels.

 Because MDC-L and 41 both exhibit a predominantly leukocyte expression pattern, interaction between these two cell surface molecules may occur on the same cell surface or at a site of cell-cell contact. The metalloprotease domain of mouse (33) and human3 MDC-L are active and autocatalytic with regard to cleavage of the regulatory prodomain. The interaction of MDC-L with 41 on the same cell surface may act to target this potential sheddase to proteins such as VCAM-1. Interestingly, as shown for fibronectin, MDC-L may interact with a site on 41 distinct from VCAM-1 allowing simultaneous binding (36). Conversely, binding of 41 on the same cell surface may function to sequester the active protease away from potential target proteins such as L-selectin or FasL. If MDC-L is capable of interacting with 41 on a neighboring cell, it may function as a counter-receptor and target the active protease to substrates at the site of cell-cell contact. Determining which of these roles is possible will depend on further analysis of the MDC-L-41 interaction. Determining whether 41 binding of MDC-L occurs on the same cell surface and/or between cells may shed light on the physiologically relevant substrate for this metalloprotease.

 The potential binding of MS2 CP to secY (isolate No. 6) may affect budding of the phage, since SecY is known to interact with phage coat proteins (60). The binding may also make the cell resistant to other phages, because secY is necessary for export of many surface proteins, such as phage receptor (61).

 Protein Stability Under Conditions of Freeze-substitution For an aptamer-labeling strategy to work, a protein target, such as EGFP, must retain its structure during fixation. Because fluorescence is a good indicator of EGFP's conformation, we have used this readily measurable parameter to assess the effects of different treatments on the conformation of EGFP.

 The study of closely similar proteins, such as the natural variants of cytochromes c3 from Dsmn and Dsmb, presents the advantage of probing modifications in the primary sequence that are obviously compatible with the maintenance of function. Thus, it may help to characterize the biological factors relevant to the evolution of the protein function.

 Although collagen is a major constituent of the interstitial matrix in the lung (30), the ability of ANG II to enhance the synthesis of other matrix proteins such as fibronectin or proteoglycans (crucial to collagen structure and mesenchymal cells) deserves attention in future studies, particularly because the synthesis of these proteins may be coregulated.

 In the nervous system, fission of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane to generate endocytic vesicles is thought to involve the GTPase dynamin (54). In the present study, we used a dynamin II-specific antibody to show that this protein is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is found associated with membranes (Fig. 1). Insulin stimulation diminished the amount of dynamin II associated with the plasma membranes. The mechanism by which insulin reduces dynamin association with the cell surface is unknown, but we note that this decrease is not paralleled by a decrease in clathrin associated with the plasmalemma. It is conceivable that loss of dynamin from the surface may occur upon internalization of occupied insulin receptors since receptor internalization is increased upon insulin binding (55). We hypothesize that insulin may remove dynamin as one of the steps to limit internalization of proteins such as GLUT4. This could potentially also lead to the accumulation at the cell surface of other recycling proteins such as the transferrin and mannose 6-phosphate receptors, whose concentrations increase in response to the hormone (56-59). In addition, it is possible that insulin prevents the interaction of GLUT4 proteins with components of the coated pits, as suggested by electron microscopy and biochemical observations (4, 5).
