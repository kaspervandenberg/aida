The service can be either deployed/undeployed from the command line as follows
(for Windows):

java -cp "%AXISCLASSPATH%" org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient -p8084 deploy.wsdd
java -cp "%AXISCLASSPATH%" org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient -p8084 undeploy.wsdd

where port has to be changed according to the seetings a user has. Please make sure
the environmental variable $AXISCLASSPATH includes all standard Axis jars from, such
as axis.jar, jaxrpc.jar, etc.

Another option is to use the provided build.xml. In the latter case, a service is deployed
by 

ant compile
ant install

and undeployed by 

ant remove

It was tested using JDK 1.5.0, Ant 1.6.5 (http://ant.apache.org/), and Tomcat 5.5.9.
