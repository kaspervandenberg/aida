<b>Purpose</b>: To train learning methods on the data provided by the user & to create a learning model for a given task. The task is to carry out named entity recognition (concept learning) based on the text context.

<br><br>
This is a Learner, service which provides the following functionality: it makes use of a user's annotation to build a model
which might be used to annotate the unseen data. It also provides the information on how well this model performs on the
training data set (provided by a user) based on the 10-fold cross-validation.<br>

<br><br>
<b>Input</b>:
<br>
train_set (String)  - annotated data in XML file. All tags apart from <document> (and tags used for annotating structural parts of Medline ) are considered to be class labels.
<br>  context_window (String) - size of a context window (e.g., 2, 3, etc). It is set to 3 by default
<br>  mode (String) - mode is currently set to "a" (automatic). It is indended to add interactive mode in the future releases
<br>  model_file (String) - path with the filename where the model file must be stored (e.g., "D://INSTALL/Data/train/corpus2TTT.mod") 
<br>	inp (String) - type of the input data. It is set to "text" in the current implementation

<br><br>
<b>Output</b>:  
<ul>
<li/> <b>Direct:</b> String (performance info stored in the XML file). 
<li/> <b>Additional:</b>
<ul>
<li/>The model file (which might be used for the test purposes)
is stored with a filename provided by a user as a model_file parameter, see above).
<li/>The log file which contains the following information:
<ul>
<li/>date
<li/>training data
<li/>performance info
<li/>ARFF header needed to use a stored model. Do <b>NOT</b> delete it if you plan to use a model in the future
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<b>Part of a Client example</b>:
<br/>String endpoint = "http://localhost:8084/axis/services/LearnModel";
<br/>        Service  service = new Service();
<br/>        Call     call    = (Call) service.createCall();
<br/>        call.setTargetEndpointAddress(endpoint);
<br/>        call.setOperationName("train_model");      
<br/>        ret = (String) call.invoke( new Object[] { train_file[0], con[0], "a", "D://INSTALL/Data/train/corpus2TTT.mod", "text" } );

<b>Realization</b>: Uses Weka, SAX Parser
