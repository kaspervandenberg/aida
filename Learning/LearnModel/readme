build.xml has to be modified according to the user's settings. Fields to be most likely modified are 
the port (now the property "manager.port" is set to "8084") and catalina.home. Please note
that all changes which concern the port to be used must be also reflected in the client's
code (e.g., LearnModel\src\java\katrenko\ws\LeranModelServlet.java)


More documentation is to be found in learner.html
