The Biocreative I model used in a client was trained on the Biocreative I data set
and achieved the following results (B. Settles, ABNER toolkit):

recall precision  f-score
65.9%   74.5%	  69.9%

we also trained CRF on the Biocreative II data set ourselves and achieved the following results (supervised learning): precision around 80% and F-score around 75%.

To run a client on aida, please type

http://aida.science.uva.nl:9999/NERcrf/applyCRF

otherwise, it can be invoked by

String ret = new String();
call.setTargetEndpointAddress(endpoint + "CRFapply");
 	                call.setOperationName("apply");
 	                ret = (String) call.invoke( new Object[] { test[0], model[0], outputMode[0], "1"} );

test[0] - test data (text)
model[0] - model (if set to "1", BioCreative I model is used)
outputMode[0] - "1" (IOB format)
		"2" (SGML format)
		"3" (a list of entities)
		"4" (ABNER format)
a last parameter (tokenization) should be set to "1" to activate tokenization
