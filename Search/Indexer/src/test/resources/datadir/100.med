TI  - Application of an optimized electroporation procedure for replacement of
      the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase I gene in Nocardia corallina.
AB  - To develop a system for gene replacement in Nocardia corallina, a protocol
      for electroporation was optimized by systematic alterations of growth
      conditions, field strength, time constant and the electroporation buffer.
      Transformation efficiencies of 0.5 x 10(6) - 3 x 10(6)
      transformants/microgram plasmid DNA were obtained routinely. The gene
      encoding the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase I of N. corallina was
      cloned and interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance gene. The
      resulting plasmid was introduced into N. corallina by electroporation to
      inactivate the wild-type gene by homologous recombination.
      Kanamycin-resistant clones were screened by Southern hybridization for the
      absence of the wild-type gene and analyzed for PHA accumulation.

TI  - Gene transfer by electroporation.
AB  - Electroporation of cells in the presence of DNA is widely used for the
      introduction of transgenes either stably or transiently into bacterial,
      fungal, animal, and plant cells. A review of the literature shows that
      electroporation parameters are often reported in an incomplete or
      incorrect manner, forcing researchers to rely too much on a purely
      empirical trial and error approach. The goal of this article is to provide
      the reader with an understanding of electrical circuits used in
      electroporation experiments as well as physical and biological aspects of
      the electroporation process itself. Further, a simple paradigm is provided
      which unites all electroporation parameters. This article should be
      particularly useful to those new to the technique.

TI  - Electroporation-induced formation of individual calcium entry sites in the
      cell body and processes of adherent cells.
AB  - Electroporation is a widely used method for introducing macromolecules
      into cells. We developed an electroporation device that requires only 1
      microl of sample to load adherent cells in a 10-mm2 surface area while
      retaining greater than 90% cell survivability. To better understand this
      device, field-induced permeabilization of adherent rat basophilic leukemia
      and neocortical neuroblastoma cells was investigated by using fluorescent
      calcium and voltage indicators. Rectangular field pulses led to the
      formation of only a few calcium entry sites, preferentially in the
      hyperpolarized parts of the cell body and processes. Individual entry
      sites were formed at the same locations when field pulses were repeated.
      Before calcium entry, a partial breakdown of the membrane potential was
      observed in both polar regions. Based on our results, a model is proposed
      for the formation and closure of macromolecule entry sites in adherent
      cells. First, the rapid formation of a large number of small pores leads
      to a partial membrane potential breakdown in both polar regions of the
      cell. Second, over tens of milliseconds, a few entry sites for
      macromolecules are formed, preferentially in the hyperpolarized part of
      cell body and processes, at locations defined by the local membrane
      structure. These entry sites reseal on a time scale of 50 ms to several
      seconds, with residual small pores remaining open for several minutes.

TI  - Transient transfection of oligodendrocyte progenitors by electroporation.
AB  - The transient transfection of transgenes into oligodendrocytes offers an
      important tool for studying the function of proteins during myelin
      formation. Currently established procedures, however, have generally
      resulted in low survival rates and low levels of uptake of the transgene
      into primary oligodendrocyte progenitors. We describe an electroporation
      method which yields transient transfection of oligodendrocyte progenitors
      of up to 10-15% of the surviving cells, and provides approximately 10(4)
      surviving, transfected cells per electroporation reaction. In recent
      applications transgene expression persisted as the transfected progenitors
      progressed through subsequent stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This
      technique is expected to facilitate the study of the function of key
      proteins and lipids during the development of primary cultured
      oligodendrocytes.

TI  - Direct gene transfer into rat liver cells by in vivo electroporation.
AB  - In vivo electro-transfection efficiency and manner of transferred gene
      expression were investigated by fluorescence microscopic image analysis.
      Green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was used as the genetic marker.
      Electroporation was carried out on the liver of live rats by use of disk
      electrodes mounted in the tips of tweezers, which were directly pressed
      onto the surface of a liver lobe in situ. Electroporation with eight
      electric pulses of 50 ms in duration at 50 V gave a good efficiency of
      transfection as judged by the induced GFP expression. Bright fluorescence
      of GFP appeared as dots, which were scattered around the area damaged by
      electroporation. The transfection efficiency increased as the amount of
      injected DNA was increased. The results indicate that the amount of
      induced gene expression can be controlled. Estimation of the efficiency of
      electro-gene transfer using the fluorescence of GFP and digital analysis
      of microscopic images was useful to determine the optimum conditions for
      local gene therapy in tissues and organs.

TI  - High-efficiency transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by
      electroporation.
AB  - We have established a high-efficiency method for transforming the
      unicellular, green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by electroporation.
      Electroporation of strains CC3395 and CC425, cell wall-less mutants devoid
      of argininosuccinate lyase (encoded by ARG7), in the presence of the
      plasmid pJD67 (which contains ARG7) was used to optimize conditions for
      the introduction of exogenous DNA. The conditions that were varied
      included osmolarity, temperature, concentration of exogenous DNA, voltage
      and capacitance. Following optimization, the maximum transformation
      frequency obtained was 2 x 10(5) transformants per microg of DNA; this
      frequency is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained with the current
      standard method using glass beads to introduce exogenous DNA. The
      electroporation procedure described in this article is of general utility,
      and makes it feasible to isolate genes by direct complementation of
      Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants.

TI  - Preparation of red blood cells containing exogenous hemoglobin.
AB  - A technique is described for opening the membrane of a red blood cell by
      electroporation in a manner which permits free exchange of the native
      hemoglobin with exogenous hemoglobin in the surrounding medium. After
      resealing the RBC's demonstrate near normal size and hemoglobin content
      and retain an effective methemoglobin reduction system. This method can be
      used to introduce natural or genetically engineered hemoglobins with
      altered oxygen binding characteristics. Allosteric effectors and other
      non-diffusible small molecules can be encapsulated during the same
      procedure. A fish Root effect hemoglobin exchanged into rat RBC's produced
      oxygen transport characteristics, unloading at high pressure at acidic pH,
      which should be useful to treat tissue hypoxia from a variety of causes.

TI  - Altering the biochemical state of individual cultured cells and organelles
      with ultramicroelectrodes.
AB  - We describe an efficient technique for the selective chemical and
      biological manipulation of the contents of individual cells. This
      technique is based on the electric-field-induced permeabilization
      (electroporation) in biological membranes using a low-voltage pulse
      generator and microelectrodes. A spatially highly focused electric field
      allows introduction of polar cell-impermeant solutes such as fluorescent
      dyes, fluorogenic reagents, and DNA into single cells. The high spatial
      resolution of the technique allows for design of, for example, cellular
      network constructions in which cells in close contact with each other can
      be made to possess different biochemical, biophysical, and morphological
      properties. Fluorescein, and fluo-3 (a calcium-sensitive fluorophore), are
      electroporated into the soma of cultured single progenitor cells derived
      from adult rat hippocampus. Fluo-3 also is introduced into individual
      submicrometer diameter processes of thapsigargin-treated progenitor cells,
      and a plasmid vector cDNA construct (pRAY 1), expressing the green
      fluorescent protein, is electroporated into cultured single COS 7 cells.
      At high electric field strengths, observations of dye-transfer into
      organelles are proposed.

TI  - Optimisation of electroporation for biochemical experiments in live cells.
AB  - To introduce into cells small molecules, which do not permeate the cell
      membrane naturally, electroporation is the fastest and most efficient
      technique. Although it is not completely benign, the speed at which a full
      population of cells can be permeated gives it a strong advantage over all
      other cell permeation techniques. Here we describe the potential damaging
      effects of electroporation and how to derive conditions which avoid these
      and assure its use for biochemical experiments in live cells.

TI  - Kinetics of sealing for transient electropores in isolated mammalian
      skeletal muscle cells.
AB  - Permeabilization of the plasma membrane by electrical forces
      (electroporation) can be either transient or stable. Although the exact
      molecular mechanics have not yet been described, electroporation is
      believed to initiate primarily in the lipid bilayer. To better understand
      the kinetics of membrane permeabilization, we sought to determine the time
      constants for spontaneous transient pore sealing. By using isolated rat
      flexor digitorum brevis skeletal muscle cells and a two-compartment
      diffusion model, we found that pore sealing times (tau p) after transient
      electroporation were approximately 9 min. tau p was not significantly
      dependent on the imposed transmembrane potential. We also determined the
      transmembrane potential (delta Vm) thresholds necessary for transient and
      stable electroporation in the skeletal muscle cells. delta VmS ranging
      between 340 mV and 480 mV caused a transient influx of magnesium,
      indicating the existence of spontaneously sealing pores. An imposed delta
      Vm of 540 mV or greater led to complete equilibration of the intracellular
      and extracellular magnesium concentrations. This finding suggests that
      stable pores are created by the larger imposed transmembrane potentials.
      These results may be useful for understanding nerve and skeletal muscle
      injury after an electrical shock and for developing optimal strategies for
      accomplishing transient electroporation, particularly for gene
      transfection and cell transformation.

      electrochemotherapy (ECT), uses high-voltage pulses to deliver drugs
      across cancerous tissues. ECT has been demonstrated to be an effective
      treatment for cutaneous malignancies. Recent studies also indicate that
      the applications of ECT can be extended from the treatment of cutaneous
      cancers to the treatment of tumors of vital organs such as brain, liver,
      lungs and others. This review also discusses electrogene antitumor

TI  - Long duration electroporation for achieving high level expression of
      glucocorticoid receptors in mammalian cell lines.
AB  - A method is presented that utilizes long duration electroporation (LDE) to
      more efficiently introduce DNA into mammalian cell lines than standard
      electroporation techniques. With SV40-based vectors, more than 550,000
      glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) per cell could be obtained in COS-7 cells
      with good cell survival. In experiments with a CMV-driven vector
      expressing an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP), 54% of the cells
      were transfected, and 77% of EGFP positive cells expressed EGFP at
      moderate to high levels. In cell lines not containing the large T antigen,
      a CMV-driven vector for the GR was superior to the SV40-based vector. In
      EDR3, DG44, and CV-1 cell lines approximately 220,000, 190,000 and 150,000
      GRs/cell were obtained, respectively. Transfection efficiency of the EGFP
      vector ranged from 44 to 55% for the three cell lines. Cortisol treatment
      of COS-7 and DG44 cultures cotransfected with vectors expressing the GR
      and a GRE driven luciferase gene produced 4 to 12 times more enzyme
      activity per plate with LDE than conventional electroporation protocols.
      LDE allows transient overexpression of proteins in COS-7 cells at the high
      levels generally achieved by mammalian overexpression systems only in
      stable cell lines.

TI  - Electric pulse-induced precipitation of biological macromolecules in
      electroporation.
AB  - We found that electric discharge through solution of biological
      macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins) causes precipitation of significant
      portions of these macromolecules. This precipitation is a consequence of
      the interaction of biological macromolecules with the metal ions
      solubilized from the anode plate by the electric pulse, and occurs in both
      absence and presence of the cells in poration medium. Precipitated
      fractions of macromolecules sediments at the centrifugation speed used to
      pellet eukaryotic cells and does not dissolve when washed with buffer. Our
      data indicate a complication of the direct evaluation of electroporation
      efficiency based on the assumption that electroporated biological
      macromolecules which remain associated with the cells after several
      washes, are successfully electroinjected into the cytoplasm of cells.

TI  - Electroporation therapy: a new approach for the treatment of head and neck
      cancer.
AB  - Electroporation can deliver exogenous molecules like drugs and genes into
      cells by pulsed electric fields through a temporary increase in cell
      membrane permeability. This effect is being used for the treatment of
      cancer by intratumoral injection of low dosage of an otherwise marginally
      effective chemotherapeutic drug, bleomycin. Application of a pulsed
      electric field results in substantially higher uptake of the drug and
      enhanced killing of the cancer cells than is possible by conventional
      methods. The MedPulser, a new treatment system for local electroporation
      therapy (EPT) of head and neck tumors was developed and is described in
      this paper. EPT with bleomycin has been found to be very effective in
      killing cancer cells in vitro, in mouse tumor xenografts in vivo, and in
      tumors in humans. Ten head and neck cancer patients with recurring or
      unresponsive tumors were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial.
      Treatment of the entire tumor mass in each of eight patients resulted in
      five complete responses confirmed by biopsy and MRI, and three partial
      responses (> or = 50% shrinkage). Two additional patients who received
      partial treatment of their tumor mass had local response where treated,
      but no overall lesion remission. Duration of the complete responses ranges
      from 2-10 months to date. All patients tolerated the treatment well with
      no significant local or systemic adverse effects.

TI  - In vivo electroporation for genetic manipulations of whole Hydra polyps.
AB  - In vivo electroporation is used to study gene regulation and gene function
      in the freshwater polyp Hydra. Although this approach has been used
      successfully by several investigators, efficacy and handling continue to
      present a problem. Here we show technical aspects of in vivo
      electroporation for introducing fluorescent dyes, plasmid DNA and double
      stranded RNA into Hydra polyps. We describe the fundamentals of the
      electroporation delivery system, discuss recent studies where this
      approach has been used successfully, compare it to alternative
      transfection methods such as lipofection, and identify future directions.

TI  - Targeted electroporation in Xenopus tadpoles in vivo--from single cells to
      the entire brain.
AB  - Electroporation is becoming more popular as a technique for transfecting
      neurons within intact tissues. One of the advantages of electroporation
      over other transfection techniques is the ability to precisely target an
      area for transfection. Here we highlight this advantage by describing
      methods to restrict transfection to either a single cell, clusters of
      cells, or to include large portions of the brain of the intact Xenopus
      tadpole. Electroporation is also an effective means of gene delivery in
      the retina. We have developed these techniques to examine the effects of
      regulated gene expression on various neuronal properties, including
      structural plasticity and synaptic transmission. Restriction of
      transfection to individual cells aids in imaging of neuronal morphology,
      while bulk cell transfection allows examination of the affects of gene
      expression on populations of cells by biochemical assays, imaging, and
      electrophysiological recording.

TI  - Using electroporation and lipid-mediated transfection of GFP-expressing
      plasmids to label embryonic avian cells for vital confocal and two-photon
      microscopy.
AB  - Fluorescent proteins have emerged as an ideal fluorescent marker for
      studying cell morphologies in vital systems. These proteins were first
      applied in whole organisms with established germ-line transformation
      protocols, but now it is possible to label cells with fluorescent proteins
      in other organisms. Here we present two ways to introduce GFP expressing
      plasmids into avian embryos for vital confocal and two-photon imaging.
      First, electroporation is a powerful approach to introduce GFP into the
      developing neural tube, offering several advantages over dye labeling.
      Second, we introduce a new lipid-based transfection system for introducing
      plasmid DNA directly to a small group of injected cells within live, whole
      embryos. These complementary approaches make it possible to transfect a
      wide-range of cell types in the avian embryo and the bright, stable,
      uniform expression of GFP offers great advantages for vital fluorescence
      imaging.

TI  - Recovery of adherent cells after in situ electroporation monitored
      electrically.
AB  - Here we describe various experiments that address the efficiency of
      loading extracellular probes into the cytoplasm of adherent mammalian
      cells (normal rat kidney, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and African green
      monkey) by means of in situ electroporation. Subsequent cell recovery from
      the electroporation pulse was monitored electrically in real time for each
      condition. In this study, small, gold-film electrodes (5 x 10(-4) cm2) are
      used as culture substrates and at the same time as an electrode for both
      the application of the electroporating voltage pulse and the noninvasive
      electrical monitoring of cell recovery, using a technique referred to as
      ECIS. Electroporation has been performed by using ac sinusoidal voltage
      pulses of varying frequency, amplitude, and duration. Permeabilization and
      re-closure of the plasma membrane were evaluated by the uptake of the
      fluorescence probe, Lucifer Yellow, from the extracellularfluid. With the
      experimental setup described here, efficient electroporation was achieved
      with voltages less than 5 V. Using ECIS, we followed the morphological
      response of the cells to the electricfield-induced membrane
      permeabilization. For optimized electroporation conditions, cell recovery
      was completed in less than 1 h. The introduction of membrane-impermeable
      substances by electroporation and in situ monitoring of the cellular
      response mayfind many applications in cell biology.

TI  - Efficient genetic modification of murine dendritic cells by
      electroporation with mRNA.
AB  - Recently, human dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with mRNA encoding a broad
      range of tumor antigens have proven to be potent activators of a primary
      anti-tumor-specific T-cell response in vitro. The aim of this study was to
      improve the mRNA pulsing of murine DC. Compared to a standard lipofection
      protocol and passive pulsing, electroporation was, in our hands, the most
      efficient method. The optimal conditions to electroporate murine bone
      marrow-derived DCs with mRNA were determined using enhanced green
      fluorescent protein and a truncated form of the nerve growth factor
      receptor. We could obtain high transfection efficiencies around 70-80%
      with a mean fluorescence intensity of 100-200. A maximal expression level
      was reached 3 hours after electroporation. A clear dose-response effect
      was seen depending on the amount of mRNA used. Importantly, the
      electroporation process did not affect the viability nor the
      allostimulatory capacity or phenotype of the DC. To study the capacity of
      mRNA-electroporated DCs to present antigen in the context of MHC classes I
      and II, we made use of chimeric constructs of ovalbumin. The
      dose-dependent response effect and the duration of presentation were also
      determined. Together, these results demonstrate that mRNA electroporation
      is a useful method to generate genetically modified murine DC, which can
      be used for preclinical studies testing immunotherapeutic approaches.

TI  - Conditions for gene transfection into the HL-60 human leukaemia cell line
      by electroporation.
AB  - Electroporation represents a powerful technique for cell transfection;
      however, its efficiency in haemopoietic cells (approximately 1%) is
      largely unsatisfactory. Biological processes in haemopoietic cells are
      often studied using leukaemia cell line HL-60. For this reason we
      developed conditions for efficiently introducing plasmids to HL-60 cells
      by electroporation, as an alternative to other techniques. This technique
      employs the electric pulse (250-270 V; 1000 microF) followed by separation
      of living cells on a Ficoll-Paque discontinuous gradient. Using 10-20
      micrograms of plasmid, we routinely achieve 12-14% of transfectants.

TI  - Effects of electroporation on primary rat hepatocytes in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of electroporation on primary rat
      hepatocyte and to optimize the electroporation conditions introducing
      foreign genes into primary hepatocytes. METHODS: A single-pulse procedure
      was performed at low voltage (220-400 V) but with high capacitance
      (500-950 microF). Hepatocytes were divided into 4 groups according to the
      electroporation conditions: group I, 220 V and 500 microF; group II, 220 V
      and 950 microF; group III, 400 V and 950 microF,and group IV. The control
      group was freshly isolated hepatocytes and directly cultured under the
      same conditions as those of electroporation groups. The effects of
      electroporation on primary rat hepatocytes were detected by trypan blue
      exclusion (TBE) and MTT analysis. Besides, albumin (Alb), alanine
      transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the supernatants of
      cultured hepatocytes were measured by biochemical assay. RESULTS: Between
      day 1 and day 15 after incubation, primary rat hepatocytes of each
      electroporation group appeared normal, being the same with those of
      control group. TBE staining showed that slight hepatocyte damage and high
      survival rate were found in the electroporation groups and the control
      group. Cultured for 3, 7, 11 and 15 days, hepatocyte viability was
      approximately 92.6+/-2.5 %, 89.5+/-3.3 %, 82.0+/-3.5 % and 74.3+/-1.2 %,
      respectively. MTT analysis indicated that the viabilities of hepatocytes
      had no significant difference between each electroporation group, and
      those were similar to that of control group. At the 36th hour after
      electroporation, Alb, ALT and LDH in the supernatants of control group
      were 5.3+/-0.1 g x L(-1), 183.7+/-8.4 nkat x L(-1) and 896.8+/-58.5 nkat x
      L(-1); those of group II were 5.7+/-0.1 g x L(-1), 215.4+/-16.7 nkat x
      L(-1) and 1063.8+/-51.8 nkat x L(-1); and those of group III were
      5.8+/-0.2 g x L(-1), 217.1+/-8.4 nkat x L(-1) and 1063.8+/-10.0 nkat x
      L(-1). Statistically, the proteins of group II and group III were
      significantly higher than those of control group (P<0.05), whereas the
      protein production of group I, Alb, ALT and LDH were 5.3+/-0.2 g x L(-1),
      205.4+/-3.3 nkat x L(-1) and 1035.4+/-116.9 nkat x L(-1), were similar to
      those of control group. At the same time, TBE and MTT analysis indicated
      that there was no significant cell viability difference between
      electroporation groups and control group. CONCLUSION: This single-pulse
      electroporation procedure performed at low voltage (220-400 V) but with
      high capacitance (950 microF) is one of the optimal choices to introduce
      foreign genes into primary rat hepatocyte.

TI  - Electroporation of primary neural cultures: a simple method for directed
      gene transfer in vitro.
AB  - Gene transfer into cells of the nervous system is an important method to
      analyze tissue-specific gene functions. Although highest transfection
      efficiencies are generally obtained by viral gene transfer, non-viral
      methods are attractive because they are less labor intensive and more
      suitable for high throughput screening approaches. Here we describe an
      approach for electroporation-based gene transfer into primary neural cells
      isolated from dissociated murine cerebella. Using GFP as reporter
      molecule, we show that electroporation allows for efficient gene transfer
      into embryonic and postnatal neural cells under highly controlled
      experimental conditions. Furthermore we show that adaptation of
      electroporation parameters allowed for the preferential transfection of
      subsets of neural cells within the mixed primary culture. Using
      electroporation settings of high voltage and low capacitance (500 V/50
      microF) we achieved a transfection efficiency of about 10% of small neural
      cells which were identified as granule cells by the expression of the
      granule cell-specific marker NeuN. At electroporation settings of 220
      V/975 microF, large and stellate-shaped cells that comprised about 10% of
      the GFAP-positive population of astrocytes were preferentially
      transfected. We conclude that electroporation of primary neural cells can
      be used to target gene transfer to subsets of neural cells.

TI  - Single-cell electroporation.
AB  - Electroporation is a widely used method for the introduction of polar and
      charged agents such as dyes, drugs, DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides, and
      amino acids into cells. Traditionally, electroporation is performed with
      large electrodes in a batch mode for treatment of a large number of cells
      in suspension. Recently, microelectrodes that can produce extremely
      localized electric fields, such as solid carbon fiber microelectrodes,
      electrolyte-filled capillaries and micropipettes as well as chip-based
      microfabricated electrode arrays, have proven useful to electroporate
      single cells and subcellular structures. Single-cell electroporation opens
      up a new window of opportunities in manipulating the genetic, metabolic,
      and synthetic contents of single targeted cells in tissue slices, cell
      cultures, in microfluidic channels or at specific loci on a chip-based
      device.

TI  - Digression on membrane electroporation for drug and gene delivery.
AB  - Membrane electroporation (ME) defines an electrical technique to render
      lipid membranes porous and permeable, transiently and reversibly, by
      external voltage pulses. Although there are numerous applications of ME to
      manipulate cells, organelles and tissues in cell biology, biotechnology
      and medicine, yet the molecular mechanism of ME is only slowly being
      understood. A general chemical- thermodynamical approach for the
      quantitative description of cell membrane electroporation has been
      developed to provide the framework to quantitatively rationalize
      electroporative cell transformation and electroporative uptake of
      drug-like dyes into cells, as well as electrolyte efflux from salt-filled
      electroporated vesicles. Mechanistically, the electroporative transfer of
      gene and drug-like dyes involves the coupling between an interactive
      contact formation of the permeates with the cell surface membrane and the
      structural electroporation-resealing cycle C <--> (P) where C is the
      closed and (P) represents a number of different porated membrane states,
      respectively. The experimentally accessible concentration fraction f(p) =
      [(P)] / ([C] + [(P)]) of porous states is related to thermodynamic and
      electro-mechanic parameters such as temperature and the electric field
      strength, membrane rigidity or curvature. The results of the theoretical
      approach, mainly based on electrooptical data of lipid vesicles, have been
      successfully used to analyze single cells and to specify conditions for
      the practical purpose of direct electroporative gene transfer and drug
      delivery, in particular in the new medical disciplines of electroporative
      chemotherapy and electroporative gene vaccination.

TI  - Highly efficient, large volume flow electroporation.
AB  - Electroporation is widely used to transfect and load cells with various
      molecules. Traditional electroporation using a static mode is typically
      restricted to volumes less than 1 mL, which limits its use in clinical and
      industrial bioprocessing applications. Here we report efficient, large
      volume transfection results by using a scalable-volume electroporation
      system. Suspended (Jurkat) and adherent cells (10T1/2 and Huh-7) were
      tested. A large macromolecule, FITC-conjugated dextran (MW=500 kD) was
      used to measure cell uptake, while a plasmid carrying the gene coding for
      enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was used to quantitate the flow
      electrotransfection efficiency as determined by flow cytometry. The flow
      electroloading efficiency of FITC-dextran was >90%, while the cell
      viability was highly maintained (>90%). High flow electrotransfection
      efficiency (up to 75%) and cell viability (up to 90%) were obtained with
      processing volumes ranging from 1.5 to 50 mL. No significant difference of
      electrotransfection efficiency was observed between flow and static
      electrotransfection. When 50 mL of cell volume was processed and samples
      collected at different time points during electroporation, the transgene
      expression and cell viability results were identical. We also demonstrated
      that DNA plasmid containing EBNA1-OriP elements from Epstein-Barr virus
      were more efficient in transgene expression than standard plasmid without
      the elements (at least 500 too 1000-fold increase in expression level).
      Finally, to examine the feasibility of utilizing flow electrotransfected
      cells as a gene delivery vehicle, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with a DNA
      plasmid containing the gene coding for mIL12. mIL12 transfected cells were
      injected subcutaneously into mice, and produced functional mIL12, as
      demonstrated by anti-angiogenic activity. This is the first demonstration
      of efficient, large volume, flow electroporation and the in vivo efficacy
      of flow electrotransfected cells. This technology may be useful for
      clinical gene therapy and large-scale bioprocesses.

TI  - Electroporation: theory and methods, perspectives for drug delivery, gene
      therapy and research.
AB  - Electroporation designates the use of short high-voltage pulses to
      overcome the barrier of the cell membrane. By applying an external
      electric field, which just surpasses the capacitance of the cell membrane,
      transient and reversible breakdown of the membrane can be induced. This
      transient, permeabilized state can be used to load cells with a variety of
      different molecules, either through simple diffusion in the case of small
      molecules, or through electrophoretically driven processes allowing
      passage through the destabilized membrane--as is the case for DNA
      transfer. Initially developed for gene transfer, electroporation is now in
      use for delivery of a large variety of molecules: From ions to drugs,
      dyes, tracers, antibodies, and oligonucleotides to RNA and DNA.
      Electroporation has proven useful both in vitro, in vivo and in patients,
      where drug delivery to malignant tumours has been performed. Whereas
      initial electroporation procedures caused considerable cell damage,
      developments over the past decades have led to sophistication of equipment
      and optimization of protocols. The electroporation procedures used in many
      laboratories could be optimized with limited effort. This review (i)
      outlines the theory of electroporation, (ii) discusses factors of
      importance for optimization of electroporation protocols for mammalian
      cells, (iii) addresses particular concerns when using electroporation in
      vivo, e.g. effects on blood flow and considerations regarding choice of
      electrodes, (iv) describes DNA electrotransfer with emphasis on use in the
      in vivo setting, and (v) sums up data on safety and efficacy of
      electroporation used to enhance delivery of chemotherapy to tumours in
      cancer patients.

TI  - A comparison of efficacy and toxicity between electroporation and
      adenoviral gene transfer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroporation of skeletal muscle after injection of naked
      DNA was shown by others to increase transgene expression. Information
      regarding tissue damage caused by electroporation is conflicting. It is
      also not well known how plasmid electroporation compares with transfection
      by adenoviral vectors. To investigate these questions the most used
      protocol for muscle electroporation was used, i.e. 8 pulses of 200 V/cm
      and 20 ms at a frequency of 1 Hz. RESULTS: Intra-muscular DNA transfer of
      pLuciferase was increased by 2 logs after electroporation, confirming data
      described by others. However, the blood levels of the encoded protein were
      still lower than those obtained after injection of first generation
      adenoviral vectors. Also, the electroporation procedure, on its own,
      caused severe muscle damage consisting of rhabdomyolysis and infiltration,
      whereas the adenoviral vectors caused only a slight infiltration. As
      damage of targeted tissue may be an advantage in the case of tumour
      transfection, we also compared the two transfection methods in tumour
      tissue. In case of poorly permissive tumours, adenoviral vectors cannot
      transfect more than 2% of the tumour tissue without inducing significant
      liver damage. In contrast, the electroporation seems to offer a wider
      therapeutic window since it does not cause any systemic toxicity and still
      induce's significant transfection. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmid electroporation of
      the muscle induce severe local damage and is of no advantage over
      adenoviral vectors for obtaining high blood levels of a vector encoded
      protein. In contrast, electroporation of tumours might be safer than
      adenoviral gene transfer.

TI  - Electroporation as a method for high-level nonviral gene transfer to the
      lung.
AB  - To increase the levels of pulmonary gene transfer by nonviral vectors, we
      have adopted electroporation protocols for use in the lung. A volume of
      100-200 microl of purified plasmid DNA suspended in saline was instilled
      into the lungs of anesthetized mice. Plasmids expressed luciferase, or
      beta-galactosidase under control of the CMV immediate-early promoter and
      enhancer. Immediately following delivery, a series of eight square wave
      electric pulses of 10 ms duration each at an optimal field strength of 200
      V/cm were administered to the animals using 10 mm Tweezertrodes
      (Genetronics, San Diego, CA, USA). The electrodes were placed on either
      side of the chest, which had been wetted with 70% ethanol. The animals
      recovered and survived with no apparent trauma until the experiments were
      terminated at the desired times, between 1 and 7 days post-treatment. Gene
      expression was detected by 1 day postelectroporation and peaked between 2
      and 5 days. By 7 days, expression was back to baseline. By contrast,
      essentially no gene expression was detected in the absence of electric
      pulses. Using a beta-galactosidase-expressing plasmid, the distribution of
      gene expression appeared to be concentrated in the periphery of the lung,
      but was also present throughout the parenchyma. The primary cell types
      expressing gene product include alveolar type I and type II epithelial
      cells. No inflammation or lung injury was detected histologically or by
      cytokine measurements in lungs at either 1 or 24 h following
      electroporation treatment. These results provide evidence that
      electroporation is a safe and effective means for introducing naked DNA
      into the lung and form the basis for future studies on targeted pulmonary
      gene therapy.

TI  - Electrotransfection of anchorage-dependent mammalian cells.
AB  - Reversible electropermeabilization (or electroporation) of cell membranes
      is a very efficient method for intracellular delivery of xenomolecules,
      particularly of DNA. In the case of anchorage-dependent cells, however,
      enzymatic or mechanical detachment from the substratum is required prior
      to electropulsing. This can damage the plasma membrane and lead to low
      transfection yields. Here we present an efficient method for in situ
      electroporation of mammalian cells while they are attached to a solid
      substratum. For this purpose an electroporation chamber was constructed
      that housed a cell culture insert with a cell monolayer grown on a porous
      filter. By real-time monitoring the transmonolayer resistance, the field
      pulse parameters resulting in transient and reversible permeabilization of
      cell membranes were determined for two adherent cell lines, which were
      found to differ markedly in their sensitivity to electropulsing. Based on
      the transmonolayer resistance data, the pulsing conditions for optimum
      electrotransfection of two murine cell lines with plasmid DNA could be
      established in a very short time. The transfection yield and gene
      expression were significantly higher in cell monolayers facing the cathode
      compared to those exposed to field pulses of the reverse direction. This
      might be due to contribution of the electrophoresis to the translocation
      of the polyanionic plasmid DNA across the electropermeabilized cell
      membrane. The experimental setup presented here appears to be a promising
      tool not only for rapid optimization of in situ electrotransfection of
      anchorage-dependent cells but also for studying the molecular/biophysical
      mechanisms of the membrane breakdown and resealing.

TI  - In situ electroporation of radioactive compounds into adherent cells.
AB  - We previously developed a technique, termed in situ electroporation, where
      nonpermeant molecules are introduced through an electrical pulse into
      adherent cells, while they grow on electrically conductive, optically
      transparent, indium-tin oxide (ITO). Careful control of the electric field
      intensity results in essentially 100% of the cells taking up the
      introduced material, without any detectable effect upon the physiology of
      the cell, presumably because the pores reseal rapidly so that the cellular
      interior is restored to its original state. Electroporation of radioactive
      material is faced with two important considerations: (1) potential for
      exposure of personnel to irradiation, and (2) the requirement for
      electroporation of a large number of cells. In this report, we describe a
      modification in the geometry of the slides and electrodes which permits
      the use of inexpensive ITO-coated glass of lower conductivity that can be
      discarded after use, to electroporate large numbers of cells using a
      minimum volume of radioactive nucleotide solution. The results demonstrate
      that, using this assembly, the determination of the Ras-bound GTP/GTP+GDP
      ratios through electroporation of [alpha32P]GTP can be conducted using
      approximately five times lower amounts of isotope than in previous
      designs. Moreover, this assembly permits efficient upscaling, which makes
      the determination of Ras-GTP binding in cells which are deficient in Ras
      activity possible. In addition, we demonstrate the labeling of two viral
      phosphoproteins--the Simian Virus 40 Large Tumor antigen, and Adenovirus
      E1A--through [gamma32P]ATP electroporation using this setup. In both
      cases, electroporation of the nucleotide can achieve a great increase in
      the efficiency and specificity of labeling compared to the addition of
      [32P]-orthophosphate to the culture medium, presumably because the
      immediate phosphate donor nucleotide itself is introduced, which can
      directly bind to the target proteins.

TI  - Rapid and efficient electroporation-based gene transfer into primary
      dissociated neurons.
AB  - Non-viral gene transfer into neurons has proved to be a formidable task.
      Here, we describe an electroporation-based method that allows efficient
      and reliable DNA transfer into dissociated neural cells before they are
      plated and cultured. In hippocampal neural cells derived from either
      neonatal mouse or embryonic chicken brains, a high transfection rate was
      already observed 5 h after transfection, and reached 40-80% in 24 h, as
      monitored by expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The
      level of eGFP expression per cell depended on the amount of DNA used in a
      gene transfer experiment. The survival and neuritic length of transfected
      cells resembled that of non-electroporated cells. The transfected neurons
      showed normal immunostaining for endogenous synaptic protein synaptophysin
      and the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Furthermore, efficient gene
      transfer of the NCAM isoform NCAM140 and eGFP-tagged NCAM140 could be
      achieved, allowing visualization of NCAM140 expression. Also, a
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored eGFP could be efficiently expressed,
      highlighting lipid rafts without altering electrophysiological properties
      of transfected neurons. When neurons transfected with green and red
      fluorescent proteins were cocultured, fine details of their interactions
      could be revealed in time-lapse experiments. Thus, the method provides a
      useful tool for elucidation of genes involved in different neuronal
      functions, including neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synaptic
      transmission.

TI  - Efficient transfer of antibodies into mammalian cells by electroporation.
AB  - An optimized protocol for electroporation is described which is suitable
      for introducing antibodies into mammalian cells. The method results in the
      uptake of detectable amounts of antibodies in 80% of the cells and in 40%
      large amounts are introduced. As an example, cell cycle activity
      (transition from the G1 to S phase) was inhibited by the introduction of
      monoclonal antibodies against G1-specific cyclin D1 into CV-1 and MCF7
      cells. This specific antibody mediated inhibition of cellular function did
      not affect the viability of the cells since they recovered from the
      inhibition after some time. While approaching the efficiency of
      microinjection, the new protocol for electroporation of antibodies
      additionally permits treatment of the larger number of cells which are
      required for biochemical analyses.

TI  - [The introduction of the marker gene Neor into hematopoietic stem cells by

AB  - An electroporation method has been used to introduce marker gene Neor into
      mouse stem hemopoietic cells which are capable of long-term hemopoiesis
      maintenance in marrow long-term cultures. Integration of the gene was
      tested by polymerase chain reaction. The effect of the procedure averaged
      50-80% of marked CFUc. Electroporation did little damage to hemopoietic
      cell precursors. Gene transfer can be made most effectively using bone
      marrow from mice injected 5-fluorouracil 4 days prior to the experiment.

TI  - Transformation of Escherichia coli with foreign DNA by electroporation.
AB  - Electroporation has been widely applied in molecular biology in recent
      years. In this study, successful transformation of plasmid DNA and
      transfection of phage DNA into E. coli were described by using intense
      electrical field of exponential decay waveform (electroporation) generated
      by a Gene Pulsar LN-101 (made in Tianjin, Tianjin Institute of Technology
      and Nankai University). We have obtained 10(9)-10(10)
      transformants/micrograms with strain DH5 alpha and plasmid pUC18, by a
      single voltage pulse at 1.0-2.5 kV (initial electric field strength =
      2.8-16 kV/cm) with 5-20 microF capacitor. The efficiency of
      electroporation depends on various parameters: the electric field
      strength, capacitance, the pulse length (RC time constant), etc. The
      frequency of transformation was a linear function of the DNA
      concentration, as well as the density of recipient cell. The incubation
      time of before or after electroporation has no significant effect on
      transformation. The high transfection efficiency was also achieved with
      strain JM109 and M13mp19RF by electroporation. The method was easier, more
      time-saving and more efficient than Ca(2+)-dependent transformation
      (transfection) method. The results obtained by Gene-Pulsar LN-101 was
      similar to that by the Bio-Rad Gene-Pulsar apparatus.

TI  - Studies on the effects of applied voltage and duration on human epidermal
      membrane alteration/recovery and the resultant effects upon iontophoresis.
AB  - The effects of applied voltage and the duration of application upon human
      epidermal membrane (HEM) alterations and recovery were investigated. All
      experiments were conducted using a two-chamber diffusion cell with
      constant DC voltage (250-4000 mV) applied over a predetermined period, and
      HEM changes were monitored by measuring the electrical resistance before
      and after voltage termination. The key findings were that the rate of
      decrease in resistance was strongly dependent upon the applied voltage,
      the reversible recovery times were dependent upon both the magnitude and
      the duration of the applied field (frequently were several orders of
      magnitude greater than times for attaining significant resistance
      reduction), and reversible recovery times were much longer when lower
      voltages were applied for longer times to attain the same decrease in
      electrical resistance than for higher voltages at short times. These
      findings closely parallel those obtained on electrical breakdown/recovery
      of bilayer membranes (electroporation). The second part of this work
      examined the hypothesis that decreases in HEM electrical resistance
      induced by the applied voltage are accompanied by proportional increases
      in HEM permeability. A study was designed to test this hypothesis
      involving a four-stage protocol with HEM: passive transport, 250-mV
      iontophoresis, 2000-mV iontophoresis for 10 min, then back to 250-mV
      iontophoresis. The data obtained strongly support the view that the HEM
      alterations induced by the electric field result in pore formation and in
      the expected changes in HEM permeability.

TI  - An optimized electroporation protocol applicable to a wide range of cell
      lines.
AB  - A number of transfection methods for mammalian cells are available;
      however, many cell lines may appear resistant to efficient transfection,
      or at best, necessitate lengthy optimization procedures in recommended
      protocols. We describe here an electroporation protocol that yields highly
      efficient gene transfer (20%-100% of surviving cells) in all 19 cell lines
      tested so far, including lymphoid, myeloid, glial, fibroblast and COS
      cells. Unlike earlier electroporation protocols, adaptation of this
      protocol to a cell line of interest only requires the optimization of a
      single parameter, i.e., the voltage, and can be performed within a day.
      Furthermore, it is also superior to transfection protocols for other
      methods (calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, DEAE-dextran
      transfection and transferrinfection) in terms of reproducibility, economy
      and average transfection efficiency for a wide variety of cell lines.

TI  - Localized electroporation: a method for targeting expression of genes in
      avian embryos.
AB  - Avian embryos are a popular model for cell and developmental biologists.
      However, analysis of gene function in living embryos has been hampered by
      difficulties in targeting the expression of exogenous genes. We have
      developed a method for localized electroporation that overcomes some of
      the limitations of current techniques. We use a double-barreled suction
      electrode, backfilled with a solution containing a plasmid-encoding green
      fluorescent protein (GFP) and a neurophysiological stimulator to
      electroporate small populations of cells in living embryos. As many as 600
      cells express GFP 24-48 h after electroporation. The number of cells that
      express GFP depends on the number of trains, the pulse frequency and the
      voltage. Surface epithelial cells and cells deep to the point of
      electroporation express GFP. No deformities result from electroporations,
      and neurons, neural crest, head mesenchyme, lens and otic placode cells
      have been transfected. This method overcomes some of the disadvantages of
      viral techniques, lipofection and in vivo electroporation. The method will
      be useful to biologists interested in tracing cell lineage or making
      genetic mosaic avian embryos.

TI  - Electroporation therapy of solid tumors.
AB  - The curative effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs are impeded by their
      poor permeation through the cell membrane. This limitation can be overcome
      by a novel approach called electroporation therapy (EPT),
      electrochemotherapy (ECT), or electrical impulse chemotherapy (EIC). The
      method involves application of brief electrical pulses, which destabilize
      the cell membrane barrier, allowing intracellular access of
      chemotherapeutic drugs that otherwise would not be able to penetrate the
      cell membrane effectively. EPT makes it possible to lower the drug dose,
      thereby relieving the patient of adverse side effects associated with
      conventional chemotherapy. Even with the lower drug dose, EPT has shown
      significantly higher efficacy than has conventional chemotherapy. The
      method is currently being evaluated clinically for treating various cancer
      indications using the anticancer drugs bleomycin or cisplatin. This
      article provides a historical perspective and current insights into this
      new modality of cancer treatment, including basic physical, biological,
      and medical facts about EPT; computer-assisted development of electrical
      pulse generators and electrodes necessary to create effective electrical
      fields in the treatment area; results of cancer cell and tumor treatments
      in vitro, in animals, and in humans; safety aspects of EPT; potential
      combined delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and biological agents to
      reduce or eliminate metastatic disease; and intracellular delivery of DNA
      by electroporation for cancer gene therapy.

TI  - Toxicity of anticancer agents mediated by electroporation in vitro.
AB  - Electroporation is a physical event that temporarily reduces cell membrane
      barrier properties. Diminished membrane barrier properties are achieved by
      exposing cells to pulsed electric fields. When a cell has been treated
      with electric fields it is possible for extracellular agents to gain
      access to the cell interior. This process has been used in vivo to
      increase the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents by tumor cells which
      results in dramatically higher response rates than when drug is used
      alone. This type of treatment is called electrochemotherapy (ECT);
      bleomycin is most often used as the drug for this type of treatment. It
      was hypothesized that electroporation could be used to augment the
      cytotoxicity of other anticancer agents. Therefore, this study was
      performed in order to screen 44 different combinations of drug and cell
      type in vitro to identify drugs that may have higher cytotoxicity when
      combined with electroporation. Results from seven cell types indicate that
      the IC50 of bleomycin can be reduced by a factor of 100-5000 when
      electroporation is used to facilitate internalization. The IC50 values of
      cisplatin and carboplatin could be reduced by factors ranging from 3 to 13
      in six different cell lines as a result of electroporation. These IC50
      reductions in multiple cell lines suggest that cisplatin and carboplatin
      may be effective in vivo as part of ECT treatment.

TI  - Assessment of electroporation by flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroporation accomplishes transient permeabilization of
      cells and thus aids in the uptake of drugs. The method has been employed
      clinically in the treatment of dermatological tumors with bleomycin. The
      conditions of electroporation are still largely empirical and information
      is lacking as to the interrelationships among voltage pulse height, pulse
      number and toxicity, cell permeation, drug uptake, and effects on drug
      toxicity. We used propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry to define cell
      permeation into cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments to determine the
      improvements of drug toxicity that can be accomplished by electroporation.
      METHODS: Human squamous carcinoma cells of defined TP53 status and normal
      human epithelial cells were subjected to electroporation using a square
      wave pulse generator in the range of 0-5,000 V/cm. Flow cytometry served
      to establish entry of the drug reporter, PI, into the cytoplasm and
      nucleus. A dye staining method served to establish cell survival and to
      determine the toxicity of bleomycin alone, electroporation alone, and
      electroporation with bleomycin. RESULTS: The electric field intensity
      (EFI) required to produce 50% permeabilization (EP(50)) is cell type
      dependent. The EP(50) varied from 1,465 to 2,027 V/cm. An EFI below 900
      V/cm is growth stimulatory whereas an EFI in excess of 1,000 V/cm is
      growth inhibitory. An EFI of 1,000 V/cm is sufficient to increase
      bleomycin toxicity by a factor of 2-3. A differential electroporation
      efficiency is observed between normal and tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor
      cells can be targeted preferentially at electroporation voltages where
      normal cells are less permeable.

TI  - Characterization of single-cell electroporation by using patch-clamp and
      fluorescence microscopy.
AB  - Electroporation of single NG108-15 cells with carbon-fiber microelectrodes
      was characterized by patch-clamp recordings and fluorescence microscopy.
      To minimize adverse capacitive charging effects, the patch-clamp pipette
      was sealed on the cell at a 90(o) angle with respect to the
      microelectrodes where the applied potential reaches a minimum. From
      transmembrane current responses, we determined the electric field
      strengths necessary for ion-permeable pore formation and investigated the
      kinetics of pore opening and closing as well as pore open times. From both
      patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy experiments, the threshold
      transmembrane potentials for dielectric breakdown of NG108-15 cells, using
      1-ms rectangular waveform pulses, was approximately 250 mV. The
      electroporation pulse preceded pore formation, and analyte entry into the
      cells was dictated by concentration, and membrane resting potential
      driving forces. By stepwise moving a cell out of the focused field while
      measuring the transmembrane current response during a supramaximal pulse,
      we show that cells at a distance of approximately 30 microm from the
      focused field were not permeabilized.

TI  - Electroporation dynamics in biological cells subjected to ultrafast
      electrical pulses: a numerical simulation study.
AB  - A model analysis of electroporation dynamics in biological cells has been
      carried out based on the Smoluchowski equation. Results of the cellular
      response to short, electric pulses are presented, taking account of the
      growth and resealing dynamics of transient aqueous pores. It is shown that
      the application of large voltages alone may not be sufficient to cause
      irreversible breakdown, if the time duration is too short. Failure to
      cause irreversible damage at small pulse widths could be attributed to the
      time inadequacy for pores to grow and expand beyond a critical threshold
      radius. In agreement with earlier studies, it is shown that irreversible
      breakdown would lead to the formation of a few large pores, while a large
      number of smaller pores would appear in the case of reversible breakdown.
      Finally, a pulse width dependence of the applied voltage for irreversible
      breakdown has been obtained. It is shown that in the absence of
      dissipation, the associated energy input necessary reduces with decreasing
      pulse width to a limiting value. However, with circuit effects taken into
      account, a local minima in the pulse dependent energy function is
      predicted, in keeping with previously published experimental reports.

TI  - Quantitative study of electroporation-mediated molecular uptake and cell
      viability.
AB  - Electroporation's use for laboratory transfection and clinical
      chemotherapy is limited by an incomplete understanding of the effects of
      electroporation parameters on molecular uptake and cell viability. To
      address this need, uptake of calcein and viability of DU 145 prostate
      cancer cells were quantified using flow cytometry for more than 200
      different combinations of experimental conditions. The experimental
      parameters included field strength (0.1-3.3 kV/cm), pulse length (0.05-20
      ms), number of pulses (1-10), calcein concentration (10-100 microM), and
      cell concentration (0.6-23% by volume). These data indicate that neither
      electrical charge nor energy was a good predictor of electroporation's
      effects. Instead, both uptake and viability showed a complex dependence on
      field strength, pulse length, and number of pulses. The effect of cell
      concentration was explained quantitatively by electric field perturbations
      caused by neighboring cells. Uptake was shown to vary linearly with
      external calcein concentration. This large quantitative data set may be
      used to optimize electroporation protocols, test theoretical models, and
      guide mechanistic interpretations.

TI  - Advances in plasmid gene delivery and expression in skeletal muscle.
AB  - One of the most striking recent advances for plasmid delivery in vivo has
      been that of electropermeabilization, commonly referred to as
      electroporation. This physical process exposes a muscle tissue to a brief,
      high intensity electric field that induces temporary and reversible
      breakdown of the plasma membrane. During the period of membrane
      destabilization, a variety of molecules, including plasmids, gain
      intracellular access. Electroporation has been shown to improve the
      efficiency of plasmid gene delivery to skeletal muscle of small animals by
      as much as two-orders of magnitude to levels comparable to that of
      adenoviral gene delivery. This technology will allow the muscle to be used
      as a bioreactor for the secretion of therapeutic proteins into the
      circulation. This method of gene delivery, which is simple, efficient and
      reproducible, has become valuable for basic research, with great potential
      for gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Moreover, significant progress has
      been made using a variety of molecular designs to achieve regulation of
      gene expression by low molecular weight drugs. The enhanced efficiency of
      plasmid delivery by electroporation and the resultant durability of
      transgene expression, combined with the effectiveness of drug-dependent
      transgene regulation systems, provide a powerful set of tools that will be
      broadly applicable to the development of plasmid-based gene therapies for
      the treatment of human disease.

TI  - DNA transformation of Leishmania infantum axenic amastigotes and their use
      in drug screening.
AB  - Protocols for DNA electroporation in Leishmania promastigote cells are
      well established. More recently, in vitro culture of axenic Leishmania
      amastigotes became possible. We have established conditions for DNA
      transformation of axenically grown Leishmania infantum amastigotes.
      Parameters for DNA electroporation of Leishmania axenic amastigotes were
      systematically studied using luciferase-mediated transient transfection.
      Cell lines expressing stable luciferase activity were then selected, and
      their ability to be used in an in vitro drug screening procedure was
      determined. A model was established, using axenic amastigotes expressing
      luciferase activity, for rapidly determining the activity of drugs
      directly against both axenic and intracellular amastigotes. For
      intracellular amastigotes, the 50% effective concentrations of
      pentamidine, sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam), meglumine (Glucantime),
      and potassium antimonyl tartrate determined with the luciferase assay were
      0.2 microM (0.12 microg/ml), 55 microg/ml, 95 microg/ml, and 0.12
      microg/ml, respectively; these values are in agreement with values
      determined by more labor-intensive staining methods. We also showed the
      usefulness of luciferase-expressing parasites for analyzing drug
      resistance. The availability of luciferase-expressing amastigotes for use
      in high-throughput screening should facilitate the search for new
      antileishmanial drugs.

TI  - Single-cell electroporation for gene transfer in vivo.
AB  - We report an electroporation technique for targeting gene transfer to
      individual cells in intact tissue. Electrical stimulation through a
      micropipette filled with DNA or other macromolecules electroporates a
      single cell at the tip of the micropipette. Electroporation of a plasmid
      encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the brain of intact
      Xenopus tadpoles or rat hippocampal slices resulted in GFP expression in
      single neurons and glia. In vivo imaging showed morphologies, dendritic
      arbor dynamics, and growth rates characteristic of healthy cells.
      Coelectroporation of two plasmids resulted in expression of both proteins,
      while electroporation of fluorescent dextrans allowed direct visualization
      of transfer of molecules into cells. This technique will allow
      unprecedented spatial and temporal control over gene delivery and protein
      expression.

TI  - Strategy for increased efficiency of transfection in human cell lines
      using radio frequency electroporation.
AB  - Traditional electroporation devices use direct current electric fields to
      stimulate the uptake of oligonucleotides, plasmids, short peptides, and
      proteins into a variety of cell types. A variation of this widely used
      technique is now available which relies on radio frequency (RF) electrical
      pulses. This oscillating type of electrical field reportedly elicits
      greater uptake of plasmid DNA across the plasma membrane. We evaluated a
      protocol for RF electroporation of the a human embryonic kidney cell line
      and a Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line for effeciency of transfection by
      RF electroporation. The plasmid EGFP, which codes for the widely used
      fusion protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), was used as a
      reporter of plasmid uptake after transfections. Transfection efficiency
      consistently increased approximately 30% from that typically obtained with
      conventional DC type electroporation and was accompanied by greater
      survivability of cells. Additionally, in some instances, percent
      transfection efficiency increased to over 70%. Thus, RF electroporation
      represents an improved methodology for transfection of human cell lines.
      Moreover, the RF protocol is simple to incorporate in laboratories already
      utilizing conventional electroporation devices and techniques.

TI  - Gene transfer into cultured mammalian embryos by electroporation.
AB  - To gain a better understanding of mammalian development at the molecular
      level, technology is needed that allows the transfer of exogenous genes
      into desired embryonic regions at defined stages of development. Our
      strategy has been to use electroporation (EP) of plasmid DNA following
      whole-embryo culture (WEC). In our gene transfer system, postimplantation
      rodent embryos are taken out of the uterus and a purified DNA solution of
      mammalian expression plasmid constructs is injected into the neural tube.
      A square-pulse current is delivered using an electroporator with an
      optimizer. Electroporated embryos are allowed to develop in the WEC system
      for 24--48 h. Within the targeted area, the proportion of transfected
      cells varied from 10% to approximately 100% depending on the test
      conditions (e.g., DNA concentration, voltage, duration of EP, and pulse
      number). The EP--WEC system has several advantages including rapid gene
      expression, minimal laboratory work, precisely targeted regions, and no
      risk for human beings. Application of the method is useful in improving
      our understanding of early neural development (E7--E12 in mice), e.g.,
      alteration of gene function via ectopic expression, interference with
      dominant negative proteins, and fate mapping with marker genes. In
      addition, EP can complement genetic approaches such as the generation of
      knockout and transgenic mice.

TI  - Introduction of DNA into chick embryos by in ovo electroporation.
AB  - Gene transfer by in ovo electroporation has been applied to the study of
      developmental biology, especially to central nervous system (CNS)
      development. Plasmids are injected into the neural tube of stage 10 chick
      embryos, and a 25-V 25-msec square pulse is applied five times. Since DNA
      moves toward the anode, the cathode side of the neural tube is
      transfected, and the cathode side is used as the control. Expression of
      translation product of the introduced DNA is observed 2 h after
      electroporation, peaks around 20 h after electroporation and then weakens.
      Expression is transient when plasmids are used as expression vectors, but
      they are very suitable for studying early developmental events (e.g., gene
      expression cascades or interactions). Misexpression of Pax-5 is shown as
      an example.

TI  - Gene transfer into retinal ganglion cells by in vivo electroporation: a
      new approach.
AB  - We developed a new in vivo electroporation method to deliver genes into
      retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Efficiency and degree of tissue damage were
      evaluated using green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and TUNEL. Soon after
      the intravitreous injection of the GFP gene, electroporation (five
      electric pulses of 99 ms duration each and 12V/cm delivered twice 5 min
      apart) was carried out on the adult rat eyeball with the aid of
      tweezer-type disc electrodes attached to corneal (cathode) and scleral
      (anode) surfaces. GFP expression, exhibiting a maximum on day 7, was
      detectable for up to 21 days. DiI retrograde labeling of RGCs showed that
      41.5% of the total ganglion cells in the electroinjected area were
      GFP-positive. Therefore, this new method may be a useful tool for the
      delivery of genes into RGCs.

TI  - Intracellular effect of ultrashort electrical pulses.
AB  - A simple electrical model for biological cells predicts an increasing
      probability for electric field interactions with cell substructures of
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells when the electric pulse duration is
      reduced into the sub-microsecond range. The validity of this hypothesis
      was verified experimentally by applying electrical pulses with electric
      field intensities of up to 5.3 MV/m to human eosinophils in vitro. When
      3-5 pulses of 60 ns duration were applied to human eosinophils,
      intracellular granules were modified without permanent disruption of the
      plasma membrane. In spite of the extreme electrical power levels applied
      to the cells thermal effects could be neglected because of the ultrashort
      pulse duration. The intracellular effect extends conventional
      electroporation to cellular substructures and opens the potential for new
      applications in apoptosis induction, gene delivery to the nucleus, or
      altered cell functions, depending on the electrical pulse conditions.

TI  - Electroporation of single cells and tissues with an electrolyte-filled
      capillary.
AB  - We show how an electrolyte-filled capillary (EFC) coupled to a
      high-voltage power supply can be used as a versatile electroporation tool
      for the delivery of dyes, drugs, and biomolecules to the cytoplasm of
      single cells and cells in tissues. A large-voltage pulse applied across
      the EFC (fused silica, 30 cm long, 375-microm o.d., 30-microm i.d.) gives
      rise to a small electric field outside the terminus of the EFC, which
      causes pore formation in cell membranes and induces an electroosmotic flow
      of electrolyte. When the EFC contains cell-loading agents, then the
      electroosmotic flow delivers the agents at the site of pore formation. The
      combination of pore formation and delivery enables loading of materials
      into the cytoplasm. By patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy, formation
      of pores was observed at estimated transmembrane voltages of <85 mV with
      half-maximum values around 206 mV. The electroporation protocol was
      demonstrated by introduction of fluorogenic dyes into single NG108-15
      cells, cellular processes, and small populations of cells in organotypic
      hippocampal cultures. Preliminary results are shown in which this protocol
      was employed for in vivo electroporation of ventral mesencephalon in rat
      brains. The technique was also used to access organelle-based detection
      systems inside cells. As a demonstration, 1,4,5-inositoltriphosphate was
      added to the electrolyte and detected by intracellular organelles in
      electroporated cells.

TI  - Prediction and optimization of gene transfection and drug delivery by
      electroporation.
AB  - Although electroporation is widely used for laboratory gene transfection
      and gaining increased importance for nonviral gene therapy, it is
      generally employed using trial-and-error optimization schemes for lack of
      methods to predict electroporation's effects on cells. Therefore, we used
      a statistical approach to quantitatively predict molecular uptake and cell
      viability following electroporation and show that it predicts both in
      vitro and in vivo results for a wide range of molecules, including DNA, in
      60 different cell types. Mechanistically, this broad predictive ability
      suggests that electroporation is mediated primarily by lipid bilayer
      structure and only secondarily by cell-specific characteristics. For gene
      therapy applications, this approach should facilitate rational design of
      electroporation protocols.

TI  - Elevated gastrin secretion by in vivo gene electroporation in skeletal
      muscle.
AB  - Whether or not in vivo gene transfer of gastrin gene into skeletal muscle
      by electroporation could modify gastrin secretion was examined. The
      expression plasmid vector, either pMEPrGaspA encoding the rat gastrin gene
      or pEGFP-N1 encoding the GFP reporter gene was injected into M. rectus
      abdominis of rats or M. biceps formis of mice. Subsequently, square
      electric pulses of direct current were applied six times at 25 V with a
      loading period of 100 msec per pulse. Clear foreign gene expression in the
      skeletal muscle was demonstrated by both GFP fluorescence and
      immunostaining of rat gastrin. Time course changes in plasma gastrin
      levels after transfection revealed that in rats, gastrin gene transfer
      significantly increased the plasma gastrin level for 4 weeks
      post-transfection (P<0.05), but the difference diminished at the end of
      the 10-week period. In mice, plasma gastrin level elevated similarly for 3
      weeks, and pH of gastric contents decreased in the gastrin gene
      transfected group compared with the control counterpart (P<0.05). These
      findings suggest that localized in vivo gene transfer by electroporation
      allows skeletal muscle to become an artificial endocrine tissue for
      hormonal manipulation of animals.

TI  - Electroporation for direct spinal gene transfer in rats.
AB  - We investigated the feasibility of delivering exogenous genes into spinal
      cord using direct in vivo electrotransfection. Gene transfer to the spinal
      cord was accomplished via direct intrathecal injection of pE-GFP C1
      vector, followed by five electric pulses for 50 ms at 200 V delivered
      intrathecally. The spinal cords were retrieved and analyzed with
      fluorescence microscopy, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR), and Western blotting. At day 1, 3 or 7 following electroporation
      a clear GFP expression in spinal cord tissue was detected. The most
      prominent transfection occurred in the meningeal cells and superficial
      layer of the spinal cord. Successful transfection was also confirmed with
      RT-PCR and Western blotting. The expression of GFP protein was peaked
      between 3 and 7 days after electroporation and significantly decreased at
      14 days. No behavioral or spinal neurodegenerative changes were detected
      at any time point. This study demonstrates that direct in vivo
      electrotransfection represents an effective and simple method for spinal
      gene delivery and have a potential to be used clinically, especially,
      acute or chronic pain.

TI  - Electroporated intact BY-2 tobacco culture cells as a model of transient
      expression study.
AB  - Transfer of foreign genes into plant cells can be accomplished by several
      methods: agrobacterium-mediated, microinjection, biolistic particle
      bombardment and electroporation. The last one is frequently used for
      transfection of plant protoplasts for transient gene expression.
      Electroporation is a simple procedure and allows transfecting a large
      number of cells at one time. Square wave-modulated porators are the most
      efficient for introducing expression cassettes into plant protoplasts.
      Based on a protocol developed by Wu & Feng (Plant Cell Reports, 1999, 18,
      381-386), we optimized conditions for transfection of intact Nicotiana
      tabacum BY-2 cells using square wave-modulated electroporator. To simplify
      screening for transfected gene expression we used constructs with a GFP
      marker gene.

TI  - High-efficiency gene transfer into adult fish: a new tool to study fin
      regeneration.
AB  - Zebrafish represents an excellent model to study the function of
      vertebrate genes (e.g., well-developed genetics, large number of mutants,
      and genomic sequencing in progress), inasmuch as we have tools to
      manipulate gene expression. Recent use of injected morpholinos in eggs
      provides a good method to " knockdown " gene expression in early
      development (Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000), and the "caged" RNA injected in
      eggs allows to overexpress a gene in a specific set of cells (Ando et al.,
      2001). However, a method to specifically modify gene expression in the
      juvenile or in the adult is still missing. Such a method would be a very
      powerful tool to understand gene function in differentiated tissues. We
      describe here an electroporation-based approach, which allows gene
      transfer in adult tissues. Its efficiency was assessed using a GFP (green
      fluorescent protein) dependent assay. We then used this method to disrupt
      the Fgf signalling pathway during the process of regeneration.

TI  - Single-cell electroporation.
AB  - Using modified patch-clamp methodology, we demonstrated that it is
      possible to insert genes or other compounds routinely into single cells by
      electroporation. When the cell is indented by a small-tipped
      microelectrode, a voltage of 10 V or less in the pipette is divided by the
      pipette resistance and the series resistance of the cleft between the
      pipette tip and the cell surface. The voltage at the cell membrane can be
      high enough to cause localized dielectric breakdown of the membrane and
      create pores that allow compounds in the pipette to enter the cell.
      Rectangular pulses from 20 micros to more than 300 ms are effective, as
      are frequencies from DC to 5 kHz. The most significant parameter was the
      total time for which the voltage was applied. Pipette voltages of 2-10 V
      were required, with larger genes requiring larger voltages. With optimal
      parameters, transfection rates in excess of 80% were also possible
      routinely. This approach offers an effective alternative to intracellular
      pressure injection and iontophoresis for placing genes, drugs, and other
      compounds in cells. Because of the small size of the electrode tips,
      substances can be inserted in cells from almost any location on their
      surfaces. In addition, the small tips electroporated only a limited area
      and so did little cell damage.

TI  - Regression of tumor growth and induction of long-term antitumor memory by
      interleukin 12 electro-gene therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a proinflammatory cytokine with
      antitumor activity. Plasmid-based intratumoral gene therapy for treating
      malignancy with IL-12 or other genes is safe, inexpensive, and simple to
      carry out. However, effective delivery methods for injecting DNA plasmid
      into a tumor to generate therapeutic levels of gene product are lacking.
      To overcome this obstacle, we used electroporation to deliver the IL-12
      gene intratumorally in a murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) model,
      SCCVII. METHODS: Plasmids with or without mouse IL-12 gene were injected
      into SCCVII tumors of C3H/HeJ mice (n = 5 per group). Electric pulses were
      then applied to the tumors, a process termed electro-gene therapy. The
      first treatment was administered when the tumor reached 4-6 mm in
      diameter, and the second treatment followed a week later. The tumor size,
      survival, and ability to generate systemic antitumor memory were assessed
      at various time intervals. Changes in gene expression were measured using
      northern blot analysis, and vessel density and T-cell infiltration were
      examined by immunostaining. The results were analyzed by two-sided
      Student's t tests. RESULTS: Electroporation of 20 microg or 40 microg of
      IL-12 DNA plasmid eradicated tumors in 40% of mice (P =.031 and.022,
      respectively). A total of six mice from two separate experiments with
      regressed tumors were challenged with homologous SCCVII tumor cells
      multiple times; three of six mice showed no tumor growth for more than 11
      months and thus indicated the generation of antitumor memory in these
      mice. IL-12 electro-gene therapy was associated with increased expression
      of IL-12, interferon-gamma, monokine induced by interferon-gamma, and
      interferon-inducible protein 10. IL-12 electro-gene therapy was also
      associated with decreased vessel density and increased infiltration of
      CD8(+) T cells after the second administration (P =.02 and.03,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: IL-12 electro-gene therapy appears to be
      effective in reducing tumor growth by triggering both antiangiogenic
      effects and an immune response. The antitumor memory was seen to last more
      than 11 months. Because IL-12 electro-gene therapy is easy to administer
      and is effective, it could potentially be applicable in the treatment of
      electrode-accessible malignancies, such as head and neck SCCs.

TI  - Combination of electroporation and DNA/dendrimer complexes enhances gene
      transfer into murine cardiac transplants.
AB  - Electroporation is a new gene delivery method to increase gene transfer
      and expression in vivo. Starburst polyamidoamine dendrimers have been
      demonstrated to augment gene expression in vitro and in vivo. We
      hypothesized that the combination of electroporation and dendrimer could
      enhance the gene transfer and gene expression in cardiac transplants.
      After immersion in DNA/dendrimer complexes or intracoronary transfer of
      DNA/dendrimer complexes, both nonvascularized and vascularized syngeneic
      cardiac grafts, respectively, were subjected to serial electrical pulses
      before transplantation. beta-Galactosidase reporter gene expression in the
      graft was determined by X-Gal staining. Gene expression was enhanced 10-
      to 45-fold in grafts immersed in DNA/dendrimer complexes, or after
      intracoronary transfer of DNA/dendrimer complexes, and subjected to 20
      square wave 25-ms pulses with a strength of 200 V/cm. The combination of
      electroporation and DNA/dendrimer complexes may provide a novel approach
      to enhance gene transfer and gene expression ex vivo.

TI  - Transdermal insulin delivery using lipid enhanced electroporation.
AB  - Transdermal insulin transport by electroporation was measured using
      porcine epidermis and fluorescein-labeled insulin. Previous studies have
      shown that anionic lipids can enhance the electroporative transport of
      molecules up to 10 kDa in size. It was also shown that it is the charge
      and not the type of the phospholipid head group that influences
      transdermal transport under electroporation. Moreover, phospholipids with
      saturated acyl chains enhance the transport of larger molecules more as
      compared to those with unsaturated chains. In the current study, based on
      those earlier findings, the effect of 1,2-dimyristoyl-3-phosphatidylserine
      (DMPS) on the transdermal transport of insulin by electroporation was
      examined. Porcine epidermis was used as a model for skin. Transport was
      measured using glass vertical diffusion apparatus in which the epidermis
      separated the donor and receiver compartments. Negative pulses were
      applied across the epidermis using platinum electrodes. Results show that
      when electroporation was carried out in the presence of DMPS, there was
      greater than 20-fold enhancement of insulin transport. Furthermore, while
      in the presence of the phospholipid, almost all the transported insulin
      was detected in the receiver compartment; in the absence of added lipids,
      only about half the insulin transported was in the receiver compartment
      and an almost equal amount of insulin remained in the epidermis.
      Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the insulin transport was mainly
      through the lipid multilayer regions that surround the corneocytes.

TI  - Somatic gene transfer into the lactating ovine mammary gland.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic gene therapy requires safe and efficient techniques
      for the gene transfer procedure. The ovine mammary gland is described as a
      model system for the evaluation of somatic gene transfer methods. METHODS:
      Different gene delivery formulations were retrogradely injected into the
      mammary gland of lactating sheep. The efficiency of the gene transfer was
      subsequently measured by the detection of the secreted transgene products
      in the milk. To counteract the milk flow in the lactating gland caused by
      the permanent milk production, a newly developed pretreatment of the
      mammary gland with hyperosmotic solutions was applied. In addition, in
      vivo electroporation of DNA into the mammary gland is described. RESULTS:
      Gene transfer using naked DNA or simple complexes of DNA with polycations
      did not result in traceable amounts of reporter gene products. However,
      utilizing the complex cationic lipid DOSPER, a peak expression of about
      400 ng/ml was observed 6 days after transfection. Maximum expression rates
      of more than 1 microg/ml were obtained by combining hyperosmotic
      pretreatment and receptor-mediated gene transfer. For the in vivo
      electroporation, the proof of principle for this technique in the mammary
      gland is reported. CONCLUSIONS: The ovine mammary gland turned out to be a
      very well suited as a model system for evaluation and optimization of
      various gene transfer protocols.

TI  - Electric gene transfer to the liver following systemic administration of
      plasmid DNA.
AB  - Recently, there has been an increasing level of interest in
      electroporation for gene delivery due to the site-specific nature of the
      delivery, as well as the high efficiency of the method. Electroporation
      involves the application of a pulsed electric field to cells to enhance
      cell permeability, resulting in the transit of exogenous polynucleotide
      across the cytoplasmic membrane. Electroporation is traditionally
      performed by locally injecting DNA to the site of interest followed by the
      application of electric field. Compared with the local injection of
      plasmid DNA to the liver, systemic injection has the advantage of
      delivering genes to more hepatocytes. We describe here a method for
      efficient gene transfer to the liver by electroporation following tail
      vein administration of the naked DNA. The cells expressing the reporter
      gene are more broadly distributed with this systemic injection, as
      compared with direct injection.

TI  - Electroporation-mediated pain-killer gene therapy for mononeuropathic
      rats.
AB  - The relatively low expression levels achieved from transferred genes have
      limited the application of nonviral vectors for gene transfer into the
      spinal cord in vivo. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy of electroporation-mediated pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene
      therapy for neuropathic pain using an animal model of chronic constrictive
      injury (CCI). Firstly, the optimal pulse characteristics (voltage, pulse
      duration, number of shocks) were investigated for in vivo
      electroporation-mediated gene transfer into the spinal cord. The
      electroporation process makes use of plasmid DNA, which expresses the POMC
      gene. Expression levels were evaluated in this study by Western blot. We
      conclude that the optimal conditions for electroporation are a pulse
      voltage of 200 V, 75-ms duration, 925-ms interval, for five iterations.
      Secondly, electroporation treatment for neuropathic pain was attempted on
      CCI rats using plasmid DNA that expresses the POMC gene. Intrathecal
      administrations of the POMC vector elevated spinal beta-endorphin levels,
      as manifested in a significantly elevated pain threshold for the CCI
      limbs. This result suggests that gene therapy for neuropathic pain using
      this novel technique is very efficacious, and thus shows promise for
      further clinical trials.
