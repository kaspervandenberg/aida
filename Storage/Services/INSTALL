Short Installation
====================

- Make sure you have Tomcat, Axis and Sesame
- Make sure that you have a Sesame repository, username, and password set up.
- Download and unpack sources. This should create a directory called Services.
- Set CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE
- Change to the Services directory. (The root of the Services source tree.)
- ant && touch $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/axis/WEB-INF/web.xml && touch $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/axis/WEB-INF/web.xml

IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
=============================
- If you use a different port for Tomcat than 8080, change build.xml manually to reflect this

Long Installation
====================

Install Tomcat. (tested with Tomcat 5.5.x)
- download Tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org/
- perhaps add the folling line to bin/catalina.sh around line 240 to have more memory available to Tomcat.

JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx1024m -Xms512m"

- perhaps add an echo statement somewhere too.
- consider installing what's called the Apache Tomcat Native library for your system.

IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
=============================
- set the environment variables CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE to the location where you installed Tomcat
=============================
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT

Install Axis in Tomcat. (tested with axis 1.2 - 1.4)
- download Axis from http://ws.apache.org/axis/
- copy the webapps/axis directory Tomcat's webapps directory
- download activation.jar from http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/downloads/index.html
- copy activation.jar to the webapps/axis/WEB-INF/lib directory of Tomcat

Install Sesame in Tomcat. (tested with Sesame 1.2.x, definately does not work with version 2)
- download Sesame from http://openrdf.org
- create a directory called sesame in Tomcat's webapps directory.
- use jar -xvf sesame.war to unzip the war file in Sesame's lib directory to this newly created directory.
- go to sesame/WEB-INF and adapt system.conf.example to create the repositories and users you need and save it as system.conf
- copy the jar files from Sesame's lib directory to Axis' WEB-INF/lib directory
- Set up a repository in Sesame (edit system.conf) and a user that can access it with a password. Follow the Sesame install documentation to accomplish this.


Installing from the CVS source
==============================

Currently we are moving the source from CVS on gforge.vl-e.nl to SVN on science.uva.nl. This documentation is deprecated.

Check out Services or download a nightly CVS snapshot at https://gforge.vl-e.nl/scm/?group_id=15
(You probably already did this if you're reading this.)

IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
=============================
- make sure that you have an environment variable called PWD that is set to the current working directory
  This should be the case in all Unix-like systems (such as Linux and MacOS X). I don't know about Windows.
=============================
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT

Start Tomcat.

Run ant: "ant"


Installing from the Web Archives (.war files)
=============================================

You might want to do this if you have the SVN source on one machine and want to copy the installation to another system.

Copy Services.war to Tomcat's webapps directory.
- Tomcat will automatically expand it if it's running.
- If that does not happen
        - create a directory called Services in the webapps directory
        - change to it
        - run jar -xvf ../Services.war
- Install the Java classes into Axis like this: cp -r WEB-INF/classes/* ../axis/WEB-INF/classes
- touch ../axis/WEB-INF/web.xml or restart Tomcat.


Updating from the SVN source
============================

Update the Services source.

Run ant: "ant"

If Tomcat is running:
- touch $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/Services/WEB-INF/web.xml
- touch $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/axis/WEB-INF/web.xml

Otherwise start Tomcat.
