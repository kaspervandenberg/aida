<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

<TITLE>HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death
of one thousand cuts."
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it
accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of
General Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations.
    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the
11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead
of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.
    "It minimizes the possibility of a strike," White told
reporters.
    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled by
Thursday, there will be a strike," he said.
    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,
skilled trades and job classifications, White said.
    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike
would be avoided.
    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved
we're on the right schedule to meet the target," Curd said.
    "I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," he
said.
    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the
weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.
    White said the union has also received assurances that a
job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does
not threaten Canadian jobs.
    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches
agreements at Ford &lt;F> and Chrysler &lt;C> in Canada, which
include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and
fixed annual payments for current retirees.
    It also gives workers wage increases of three pct
immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years.

<TITLE>DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian MacKenzie</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
"crushing blow."
    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    "It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one
diplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait."
    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep."
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody."
    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place."
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."
