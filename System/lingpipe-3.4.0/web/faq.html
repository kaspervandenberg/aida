<h2>General</h2>

<a name="_Toc54612893"></a>
<h3>What is LingPipe?</h3>
<p>
LingPipe is a state-of-the-art suite of natural language processing
tools written in Java that performs tokenization, sentence detection,
named entity detection, coreference resolution, classification,
clustering, part-of-speech tagging, general chunking, fuzzy dictionary
matching.  These general tools support a range of applications.
</p>
<p>
For more information see the feature list on the <a href="../index.html">LingPipe home page</a>.
</p>

<a name="_Toc54612894"></a>
<h3>Where is the LingPipe home page?</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.alias-i.com/lingpipe/">http://www.alias-i.com/lingpipe</a>
</p>


<a name="_Toc54612895"></a>
<h3>Who makes LingPipe?</h3>
<p>Alias-I, Incorporated makes LingPipe. For more information
see the <a href="http://www.alias-i.com/">Alias-i home page</a>.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612896"></a>
<h3>How did Alias-i get started?</h3>

<p>
It began in 1995 as a collaboration between a group of graduate
students at the University of Pennsylvania for the purposes of
competing in the DARPA MUC-6 (Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency Message Understanding Conference) evaluation. That sparked a
series of events which culminated in DARPA awarding a research
contract under the TIDES (Trans-Lingual Information Detection
Extraction and Summarization) program in 2000 to found Baldwin
Language Technologies, which later changed its name to Alias-i.
</p>
<p>
After using LingPipe in our FactTracker and ThreatTracker products, we
decided in September of 2003 that it was ready to be released as open
source software. In addition to working on MUC-6 and TIDES, we have
participated in many DARPA projects ranging from the ACE (Automatic
Content Extraction) and DUC (Document Understanding Conference)
evaluations to the TIA (Terrorist Information Awareness) program.
</p>
<p>
In 2004, we picked up research funding from the United States National
Library of Medicine (NLM), one of the US National Institutes of Health
(NIH).  Our grant is for text data mining over biomedical research
literature.
</p>


<a name="_Toc54612898"></a>
<h3>Where can I download LingPipe?</h3>

<p>The <a href="download.html">LingPipe download</a> page.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612899"></a>
<h3>Why would I use LingPipe?</h3>

<p>Developers building natural language processing applications
including summarization, information extraction, full text search and machine
translation will save development time by using LingPipe rather than building
and refining their own tokenization, sentence detection, named entity detection
and coreference resolution tools. </p>



<a name="_Toc54612900"></a>
<h3>What is the hard nosed business case for LingPipe?</h3>

<p>Your development team doesn't have the time to reinvent the
wheel or to create robust, fast natural language processing tools as accurate
as those in LingPipe. Using LingPipe you can finish your application sooner or
with fewer developers or both. This translates into better bottom line results.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612901"></a>
<h3>What is the warm fuzzy raison-d'etre for LingPipe?</h3>

<p>LingPipe is available under an open source license designed to let
researchers, application &amp; tool builders incorporate LingPipe into
their own open source projects. Under this license you can also use
LingPipe to annotate your document collection as long as the contents
of the document collection are made freely available to the
public. You'll sleep better knowing you're using state-of-the-art
tools from a company that cares both about staying in business and
building great tools that other people use.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612902"></a>
<h2>Technical</h2>

<a name="_Toc54612903"></a>
<h3>How do I report a LingPipe bug?</h3>

<p>See the <a href="bugs.html">LingPipe bug report</a> page.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612904"></a>
<h3>What sorts of named entities does LingPipe
recognize?</h3>

<p>This depends on what model is being used. The "standard" model supplies People, places, organizations and GSP (GeoSpatial Political
Entity). This can be changed if the named entity detector is retrained.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612905"></a>
<h3>What kind of input does LingPipe take?</h3>

<p>LingPipe is neutral with respect to input; it processes
text in unicode and supports a range of character sets and
input formats, including HTML, XML and plain text.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612906"></a>
<h3>What platforms does LingPipe run on?</h3>

<p>LingPipe will run on any platform that supports a Java
Virtual Machine (JVM), version 1.4 or higher.  It's been
extensively tested on Windows XP, Win64, Linux, 64-bit Linux,
and Macintosh OS X.
</p>
<p>
See the <a
href="install.html">LingPipe installation page</a>
for more details about the required components.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612907"></a>
<h3>How fast is LingPipe?</h3>

<p>
Very fast.  For our statistical models, the CPU is
typically waiting on memory, not on Java computations.
For heuristic models, we're typically waiting on disk
access.  LingPipe's tight loops are written very much
like they'd be written in C.
</p>
<p>The new (1.4.2 and on) Hotspot compilers do an impressive amount of
partial evaluation (aka unfolding or inlining) based on the runtime
evaluation of the running code.  That's eliminated the most
time-consuming profile/unfold step in optimization.
</p>
<p>
An exact answer in terms of megabytes/minute depends on which module
of LingPipe you're evaluating, which version of Java you're running
and on what platform/load, how fast your memory is,
whether models are dynamic or compiled, and
the particular shape of the run time task such as number of
characters, number of tags and sentence length.
</p>
<p>
We provide benchmark data as part of
some of our tutorials.
</p>




<a name="_Toc54612908"></a>
<h3>What are the memory requirements for LingPipe?</h3>

<p>LingPipe is designed to run on servers with shared memory.
A tighter answer depends on several factors, ranging from the
task being computed to the amount of caching performed.
All of the demos run in 512MB of memory.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612909"></a>
<h3>How many documents can LingPipe handle?</h3>

<p>
LingPipe doesn't store documents, so there is no limit to the
number of documents LingPipe can handle.  It runs multi-threaded,
so it can handle many documents simultaneously, but performance
is limited by CPU bandwidth.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612910"></a>
<h3>What languages/character sets does LingPipe support?</h3>

<p>LingPipe supports Unicode and can process documents in any language
with Unicode support.  This includes almost all of the major human
languages, and even some non-human languages such as Klingon.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612911"></a>
<h3>What do I need to run LingPipe?</h3>

<p>LingPipe was written in Java and requires the JVM to run.
It is distributed with everything you'll need to run it.
To build and unit test the system, it helps to install
Apache Ant.  See the <a href="install.html">LingPipe installation page</a>
for more information.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612912"></a>
<h3>How do I run LingPipe?</h3>

<p>LingPipe runs through a Java API, which is detailed in the <a
href="../docs/api/index.html">LingPipe Javadoc</a>.  Some
functionality is supported through command lines, there is a GUI demo
of some functionality, as well as web demos.  See the <a
href="demos.html">LingPipe demos page</a> for information on web
demos, the <a href="../demos/gui/read-me.html">GUI demo read-me</a>
for running the GUI demos, and <a
href="../demos/command/tutorial.html">Command line tutorial</a>

</p>



<a name="_Toc54612913"></a>
<h3>How can I process the output of LingPipe?</h3>

<p>LingPipe outputs annotated documents in an XML format. You
can process the XML however you like, but the most common ways are to use XSLT
or an XML DOM. </p>



<a name="_Toc54612914"></a>
<h3>What programming languages are the LingPipe APIs
designed for?</h3>

<p>The LingPipe APIs are designed for use in Java.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612915"></a>
<h3>Why does LingPipe output XML?</h3>

<p>XML is easily processed by a wide variety of tools and is
also human readable.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612916"></a>
<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>

<a name="_Toc54612917"></a>
<h3>What is natural language processing?</h3>

<p>Natural language processing (NLP is a branch of computer
science devoted to manipulating documents written by people with computers.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612918"></a>
<h3>What is sentence detection?</h3>

<p>Sentence detection is an early processing step common to
many natural language processing systems in which paragraphs of text are
divided into sentences based on punctuation and other information contained in
each paragraph. </p>



<a name="_Toc54612919"></a>
<h3>What is tokenization?</h3>

<p>Tokenization is an early processing step common to many natural
language processing systems in which text is divided into tokens most
of which are words but some of which are punctuation, numbers or other
symbols in order to make additional processing easier. For example, a
tokenizer might break the sentence "Yesterday, I went to the store."
into the following eight tokens:</p>

<pre>
     Yesterday
     ,
     I
     went
     to
     the
     store
     .
</pre>

<a name="_Toc54612920"></a>
<h3>What is a named entity?</h3>

<p>A named entity is a string that refers to a particular kind of
object in the world. The string "Breck Baldwin" refers to a particular
person and is therefore a named entity of type person. The string
"Alias-i" refers to a company and is also a named entity, but of type
company.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612921"></a>
<h3>What is coreference resolution?</h3>

<p>Coreference resolution is a natural language processing task
of determining whether various named entities refer to the same object in the
world. The strings "B. Baldwin" and "Dr. Baldwin" and "Breck" are likely to
refer to the same person, whereas the strings "Breck Baldwin", "Mary Smith" and
"Alias-i" almost certainly refer to different objects in the world. Coreference
resolution is most often performed on strings within one document.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612922"></a>
<h3>What is cross-document coreference resolution?</h3>

<p>Cross-document coreference resolution is the natural
language processing task of determining whether various named entities from
different documents refer to the same object in the world. It's considerably
harder than within-document coreference, in part because multiple people,
companies and places share the same name. The existence of organizations like
the <a href="http://www.jimsmithsociety.com/">Jim Smith Society</a> shows the
difficulty of this problem.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612923"></a>
<h3>What is summarization?</h3>

<p>Summarization is the natural language processing task of
producing an abstract from a document by machine.</p>


<a name="_Toc54612924"></a>
<h3>What is data mining?</h3>

<p>Data mining allows people to search for unexpected relations
in large data collections and can be applied to structured collections, such as
databases, as well as unstructured collections such as documents written in
natural language.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612925"></a>
<h3>What is full text search?</h3>

<p>Full text search allows people to use keywords to find
documents in document collections, such as the world wide web or the documents
stored in a library.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612926"></a>
<h3>What is machine translation?</h3>

<p>Machine translation systems convert documents written from
one human language into another without human intervention. For example, a
machine translation system might convert a document from Japanese into English.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612927"></a>
<h3>What is information extraction?</h3>

<p>Information extraction is the process of pulling certain
kinds of information out of documents automatically. For example, newspaper
articles can be mined for new product announcements and those announcements
could then be entered into a database.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612928"></a>
<h3>What additional resources are there about natural
language processing?</h3>

<p>There are many courses, books, journals and web sites about
natural language processing. Your favorite search engine is a good place to
start.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612929"></a>
<h3>Licensing</h3>

<p>Why do you call your license open source?</p>

<p>The term open source means many things to many people and there
isn't a universally accepted definition. We call it open source
because 1) you get source code for LingPipe when you download it 2)
you can modify LingPipe or incorporate it into your own product as
long as that product is licensed under an open source license.
</p>
<p>
The Alias-i royalty free license version 1 goes one step further than
most open source licenses we've seen in that it requires the content
you produce using LingPipe to also be freely distributed.  We want
people to build and use free software but we also want people to
freely distribute information, rather than just programs, but we also
understand that without commercial products and commercial services,
both of which provide paying jobs, that it would be hard to maintain
our software. As a result, we want to make sure that if someone
profits from using our software, Alias-i receives some revenue in the
process.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612930"></a>
<h3>Where is the Alias-i royalty free license version 1 for
LingPipe?</h3>

<p>See the <a href="licensing.html">LingPipe licensing page</a>.
</p>



<a name="_Toc54612931"></a>
<h3>Can I use LingPipe in my product?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. If your product is going to be released under an
open source license approved by the open source initiative or under the free
software license from the free software foundation, then you can do so under
the Alias-i royalty free license version 1.
</p>

<p>If you have needs that can't be met
under that license, contact Alias-i to discuss other licensing arrangements.
See the <a href="contact.html">LingPipe contact page</a> for contact
information.</p>



<a name="_Toc54612932"></a>
<h3>Can I use LingPipe to annotate my documents?</h3>

<p>Yes, but under the Alias-i royalty free license version 1 you
need to make the documents annotated by LingPipe available to the public for
free.
</p>
<p>If you have needs that can't be met
under that license, contact Alias-i to discuss other licensing arrangements.
